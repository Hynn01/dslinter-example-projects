GOOD: ----------------------------------------------------------
--- In this section there are examples of definitions that I consider
--- proper ones.

#SAMPLE 01

The Bonds are limited obligations of the Authority, secured under the provisions of the Indenture and Loan Agreement, as described herein,
and will be payable from Loan Repayments made by Stanford Health Care (the “Corporation”) under the Loan Agreement and from certain funds
held under the Indenture.

#SAMPLE 02

The 2017 Series A Bonds (the “Bonds”) are being issued as fully registered bonds and initially will be registered in the name of Cede & Co.,
as nominee for The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York (“DTC”).

#SAMPLE 03

Beneficial Owner means any Person which has or shares the power, directly or indirectly, to make
investment decisions concerning ownership of any of the Bonds (including any Person holding Bonds through
nominees, depositories or other intermediaries).

#SAMPLE 04

--- Please note, that the sentence below contains 2 possible definitions: {Obligation and Obligations}.
--- Before my update the parser would skip them both because the whole "definition term" {the text in
--- braces: /// each an 'Obligation' and collectively, the 'Obligations' ///} contains 7 words -
---  - this "term" was considered as too long for a definition.

--- I changed the logic: now the parser allows this term be so long because the term contains 2 definitions:
--- {'Obligation' and 'Obligations'}. Is it better than was before?

--- Unfortunately, the parser captured "definitions" with some extra words. Right now I'm thinking on the way
--- to make these 2 annotations being more strict.

Obligation No. 39, the outstanding Obligations relating to other indebtedness and obligations of the
Corporation (as described below) and any other Obligations issued in the future under the Master Indenture, including
the Obligation to be issued to evidence the Corporation’s obligations with respect to the payment of principal of and
interest on the Taxable Bonds (each an “Obligation” and collectively, the “Obligations”), will be secured by security
interests in (i) the Gross Revenues of each Member of the Obligated Group and (ii) the moneys on deposit from time
to time in the Gross Revenue Fund established under the Master Indenture.











BAD: -----------------------------------------------------------
-- Here WERE a number of false-positives that I've fixed.
-- E.g., the first word within the phrase followed by
-- braces

#MISS 01

CALIFORNIA HEALTH FACILITIES FINANCING AUTHORITY

Refunding Revenue Bonds
(STANFORD HEALTH CARE)

2017 Series A

#MISS 02

--- Here the parser used to find the word Corporation
--- because it: was the first word in the sentence
---   was followed by braces
--- Fixed

Obligation No. 39, the outstanding Obligations relating to other indebtedness and obligations of the
Corporation (as described below) and any other Obligations issued in the future under the Master Indenture.

#MISS 03

#MISS 04

 Operations (15,663) (9,372) (9,904)
 Purchase of property and equipment (2,288) (973) (1,320)













AVERAGE: -----------------------------------------------------------
--- ..Bonds shall be deemed.. - I don't think that it IS a definition,
--- but I don't know how to tell the parser that this case is not suitable.

#HITMISS 01

With respect to any notice of optional redemption of the Bonds, unless, upon the giving of such notice, such
Bonds shall be deemed to have been paid pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, such notice shall state that such
redemption shall be conditional upon the receipt by the Trustee on or prior to the date fixed for such redemption of
amounts sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on, such Bonds to be redeemed, and that if such amounts shall
not have been so received said notice shall be of no force and effect and the Authority shall not be required to redeem
such Bonds and such failure to redeem such Bonds shall not constitute an Event of Default.
