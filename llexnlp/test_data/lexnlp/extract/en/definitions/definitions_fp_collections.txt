NEW ISSUE — BOOK-ENTRY ONLY Ratings†

In the opinion of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, Bond Counsel to the Authority, based upon an analysis of existing laws, regulations, 
rulings and court decisions, and assuming, among other matters, the accuracy of certain representations and compliance with certain covenants, 
interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and 
is exempt from State of California personal income taxes.  In the further opinion of Bond Counsel, interest on the Bonds is not a specific preference 
item for purposes of the federal individual or corporate alternative minimum taxes, although Bond Counsel observes that such interest is included in 
adjusted current earnings when calculating corporate alternative minimum taxable income.  Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any other 
tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the Bonds.  See “TAX MATTERS” herein.

and will be payable from Loan Repayments made by Stanford Health Care (the “Corporation”) under the Loan Agreement and from certain funds 
held under the Indenture.  The obligation of the Corporation to make such payments is evidenced and secured by Obligation No. 39 issued under 
the Master Indenture, described herein, whereunder the Corporation and any future members of the Obligated Group (collectively, the “Obligated 
Group”) jointly and severally are obligated to make payments on Obligation No. 39 in an amount sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on 
the Bonds when due.  Currently, the Corporation is the sole member of the Obligated Group.

FUNDS THEREFOR PROVIDED.  NEITHER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOR THE AUTHORITY SHALL BE OBLIGATED TO 
PAY THE PRINCIPAL OR PURCHASE PRICE OF THE BONDS OR THE PREMIUM, IF ANY, OR THE INTEREST THEREON

INDENTURE, AND NEITHER THE FAITH AND CREDIT NOR THE TAXING POWER OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR OF 
ANY POLITICAL SUBDIVISION THEREOF IS PLEDGED TO THE PAYMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL OR PURCHASE PRICE OF OR 
THE PREMIUM, IF ANY, OR THE INTEREST ON THE BONDS.  THE ISSUANCE OF THE BONDS SHALL NOT DIRECTLY OR 
INDIRECTLY OR CONTINGENTLY OBLIGATE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR ANY POLITICAL SUBDIVISION THEREOF TO 
LEVY OR TO PLEDGE ANY FORM OF TAXATION WHATEVER THEREFOR OR TO MAkE ANY APPROPRIATION FOR THEIR 
PAYMENT.  THE AUTHORITY HAS NO TAXING POWER.

OFFICIAL STATEMENT 

$454,200,000 
CALIFORNIA HEALTH FACILITIES FINANCING AUTHORITY 

Refunding Revenue Bonds 
(STANFORD HEALTH CARE)  

 2017 Series A  

INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT 

The following introductory statement is subject in all respects to the more complete information set forth in 
this Official Statement.  The descriptions and summaries of various documents hereinafter set forth do not purport to 
be comprehensive or definitive and are qualified in their entirety by reference to each document.  All capitalized terms 
used in this Official Statement and not otherwise defined herein or in Appendix C have the same meaning as in the 
Master Indenture or the Indenture (each as defined below).  See APPENDIX C – “SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL 
DOCUMENTS—DEFINITIONS OF CERTAIN TERMS.” 

Purpose of this Official Statement 

This Official Statement, including the cover page and the appendices hereto, is provided to furnish 
information in connection with the sale and delivery of $454,200,000 total aggregate principal amount of California 
Health Facilities Financing Authority Refunding Revenue Bonds (Stanford Health Care), 2017 Series A (the 
“Bonds”). 

The Bonds will be issued pursuant to and secured by an Indenture, dated as of December 1, 2017 (the 
“Indenture”), between the California Health Facilities Financing Authority (the “Authority”) and The Bank of New 
York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the “Trustee”).  The Authority will lend the proceeds of the Bonds to 
Stanford Health Care, a California nonprofit public benefit corporation (the “Corporation”) pursuant to a Loan 
Agreement, dated as of December 1, 2017 (the “Loan Agreement”), between the Authority and the Corporation. 

Stanford Health Care 

The Corporation operates Stanford Hospital, a tertiary, quaternary and specialty teaching hospital (the 
“Hospital”), and the Stanford University clinics (the “Clinics”), which include primary, specialty and sub-specialty 
clinics, in which the medical faculty of the Stanford University School of Medicine provide clinical services.  The 
Corporation serves as the principal teaching affiliate of the Stanford University School of Medicine with respect to 
providing primary and specialty health services to adults and operates its facilities to provide the clinical settings 
through which the Stanford University School of Medicine educates medical and graduate students, trains residents 
and clinical fellows, supports faculty clinicians and conducts medical and biological sciences research.  The principal 
facilities of the Hospital and the Clinics are located on the campus of Stanford University adjacent to its School of 
Medicine and elsewhere in Palo Alto, California and in other communities in the San Francisco Bay Area. 

For additional information concerning the Corporation, its facilities and operations, including certain 
financial and statistical data, see APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION CONCERNING STANFORD HEALTH 
CARE.” 

The Corporation is solely responsible for the payment of principal of and interest on the Bonds.  
Neither Stanford University nor any legal entity other than the Corporation is obligated to make any such 
payments.  Stanford University and the Corporation are not co-guarantors of the debt of each other, and each 
is separately rated by the rating agencies. 

Plan of Finance 

The issuance of the Bonds is a component of the Corporation’s financing plan, which involves the issuance 
of $954,200,000 total aggregate principal amount of bonds for the benefit of the Corporation.  Such bonds will consist 



 2 

of the Bonds to be issued by the Authority as described in this Official Statement and $500,000,000 total aggregate 
principal amount of taxable bonds (the “Taxable Bonds”) that the Corporation expects to issue in January 2018.  

The proceeds of the Bonds will be used to refund certain outstanding revenue bonds previously issued by the 
Authority for the benefit of the Corporation. Costs of issuance related to the Bonds, including underwriters’ 
compensation, will be paid by the Corporation. 

The proceeds of the Taxable Bonds are expected to be used for general corporate purposes of the Corporation. 

See “THE PLAN OF FINANCE” and “ESTIMATED SOURCES AND USES OF FUNDS” herein. 

Security for the Bonds 

The Bonds are limited obligations of the Authority secured under the provisions of the Indenture, and will be 
payable solely from payments (the “Loan Repayments”) made by the Corporation under the Loan Agreement, from 
payments made by the Corporation on Obligation No. 39 (hereinafter defined), and from certain funds held under the 
Indenture.  All capitalized terms used in this Official Statement and not otherwise defined in this Official Statement 
shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Indenture or the Master Indenture, as applicable.  See 
APPENDIX C – “SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL DOCUMENTS—DEFINITIONS OF CERTAIN TERMS.” 

The obligation of the Corporation under the Loan Agreement with respect to the Bonds will be evidenced 
and secured by an obligation (“Obligation No. 39”) to be issued under the Amended and Restated Master Indenture 
of Trust, dated as of June 1, 2011 and effective as of June 16, 2011 (the “Amended and Restated Master Indenture of 
Trust”), between the Corporation, formerly known as Stanford Hospital and Clinics, and The Bank of New York 
Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as master trustee (the “Master Trustee”), as supplemented by the Supplemental Master 
Indenture for Obligation No. 39, dated as of December 1, 2017 (“Supplement No. 39”), between the Corporation and 
the Master Trustee.  The Amended and Restated Master Indenture of Trust amended and restated the Master Indenture 
of Trust, dated as of December 1, 1990 (the “Original Master Indenture”), between the Corporation, then known as 
Stanford University Hospital, and First Interstate Bank, LTD., predecessor trustee to BNY Western Trust Company 
predecessor-in-interest to The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A.  formerly known as The Bank of New 
York Trust Company, N.A.  as Master Trustee.  The Amended and Restated Master Indenture of Trust, as 
supplemented and amended from time to time pursuant to its terms, including as supplemented by Supplement No. 39, 
is herein referred to as the “Master Indenture.” 

Obligation No. 39, the outstanding Obligations relating to other indebtedness and obligations of the 
Corporation (as described below) and any other Obligations issued in the future under the Master Indenture, including 
the Obligation to be issued to evidence the Corporation’s obligations with respect to the payment of principal of and 
interest on the Taxable Bonds (each an “Obligation” and collectively, the “Obligations”), will be secured by security 
interests in (i) the Gross Revenues of each Member of the Obligated Group and (ii) the moneys on deposit from time 
to time in the Gross Revenue Fund established under the Master Indenture.  Currently, the Corporation is the only 
Member of the Obligated Group created pursuant to the Master Indenture.  See “SECURITY AND SOURCE OF 
PAYMENT FOR THE BONDS” herein. 

Notwithstanding the effectiveness of the Amended and Restated Master Indenture of Trust, provisions therein 
providing for certain actions to be taken upon the direction of the Holders of fifty percent (50%) of Outstanding 
Obligations, rather than upon the direction of the Holders of twenty-five percent (25%) of Outstanding Obligations as 
provided in the Original Master Indenture, will not go into effect until the Corporation secures the consent of the 
Holders of 100% in aggregate principal amount of Obligations Outstanding.  See APPENDIX C – “SUMMARY OF 
PRINCIPAL DOCUMENTS—MASTER INDENTURE—Defaults and Remedies—Events of Default, Acceleration; 
Annulment of Acceleration,” and “—Additional Remedies and Enforcement of Remedies” for a summary of such 
provisions.  By purchasing the Bonds offered hereunder, the purchasers and Beneficial Owners will be deemed to 
have consented to amendment of each such direction of holder provision set forth in the Amended and Restated Master 
Indenture of Trust. 

No reserve fund is being established in connection with the Bonds. 



 3 

Additional Indebtedness 

No bonds other than the Bonds may be issued under the Indenture.  However, as described below under 
“SECURITY AND SOURCE OF PAYMENT FOR THE BONDS,” the Corporation is permitted to incur additional 
indebtedness under the Master Indenture, subject to the financial tests and limitations set forth therein and described 
in Appendix C attached hereto.  See APPENDIX C – “SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL DOCUMENTS—MASTER 
INDENTURE—Covenants—Limitations on Indebtedness.” 

For a description of certain events that are expected to require the incurrence of additional indebtedness of 
the Corporation, see “SERVICES, FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS—SHC’s Long-Range Master Plan and 
Additional Capital Needs” in APPENDIX A attached hereto. 

Bondholders’ Risks 

There are risks associated with the purchase of the Bonds.  See “BONDHOLDERS’ RISKS” for a discussion 
of certain of these risks. 

Availability of Documents 

Copies of the Amended and Restated Master Indenture of Trust, Supplement No. 39, the Indenture, the Loan 
Agreement, Obligation No. 39 and the Continuing Disclosure Agreement, each as executed and delivered, may be 
examined or obtained at the expense of the person requesting the same at the corporate offices of the Corporation or 
at the designated corporate trust office of the Trustee. 

THE AUTHORITY 

General 

The Authority is a public instrumentality of the State of California (the “State”) organized and existing under 
and by virtue of the California Health Facilities Financing Authority Act, constituting Part 7.2 of Division 3 of Title 2 
of the California Government Code (the “Act”).  The intent of the State legislature in enacting the Act was to provide 
financing to health facilities and to pass along to the consuming public all or part of any savings realized by a 
participating health institution (as defined in the Act) as a result of tax-exempt financing.  Pursuant to the Act, the 
Authority is authorized to issue its revenue bonds for the purpose of financing (including reimbursing expenditures 
made or refinancing indebtedness incurred for such purpose) the construction, expansion, remodeling, renovation, 
furnishing, equipping or acquisition of health facilities operated by participating health institutions.  The State 
Treasurer is authorized under the Act to sell such revenue bonds on behalf of the Authority. 

Organization and Membership 

The Act provides that the Authority shall consist of nine members, including the State Treasurer, who shall 
serve as Chairman, the State Controller, the Director of Finance and two members appointed by each of the State 
Senate Rules Committee, the Speaker of the State Assembly and the Governor of the State.  The Chairman of the 
Authority appoints the Executive Director. 

Outstanding Indebtedness of the Authority 

As of September 30, 2017, the Authority had issued obligations aggregating $40,352,842,017 in original 
principal amount and had outstanding obligations in the aggregate principal amount of $17,294,027,318.

THE BONDS 

The following is a summary of certain provisions of the Bonds.  Reference is made to the Bonds for the 
complete text thereof and to the Indenture for all of the provisions relating to the Bonds.  The discussion herein is 
qualified by such reference. 

General 

The Bonds are being issued pursuant to the Indenture in the respective aggregate principal amounts set forth 
on the cover of this Official Statement.  The Bonds will be delivered in fully registered form without coupons.  The 
Bonds will be dated the date of delivery and will be payable as to principal, subject to the redemption provisions set 
forth herein, on the dates and in the amounts as set forth on the inside cover page hereof.  The Bonds will be 
transferable and exchangeable as set forth in the Indenture and, when issued, will be registered in the name of Cede & 
Co., as nominee of The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York (“DTC”).  DTC will act as securities 
depository for the Bonds.  Ownership interests in the Bonds may be purchased in book-entry form only, in 
denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof.  See “THE BONDS—Book-Entry System.” 

The Bonds will bear interest at the rates per annum set forth on the inside cover page hereof, payable  
semiannually on May 15 and November 15 of each year (each, an “Interest Payment Date”), commencing May 15, 
2018, to the person whose name appears on the bond registration books of the Trustee as the Holder thereof as of the 
close of business on the Record Date (which will be the first day of the month, whether or not a Business Day, in 
which an Interest Payment Date occurs) for each Interest Payment Date (except with respect to interest in default, for 
which a special record date shall be established).  So long as Cede & Co. is the registered owner of the Bonds, principal 
of and interest on the Bonds are payable by wire transfer by the Trustee to Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC, which, 
in turn, will remit such amounts to DTC Participants (as defined herein) for subsequent disbursement to the Beneficial 
Owners.  See APPENDIX E – “BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM.” 

If the book-entry system for the Bonds is ever discontinued, payment of interest on the Bonds will be made 
by check mailed by first-class mail on each Interest Payment Date to each Holder as of the Record Date for such 
Interest Payment Date at its address as it appears on the bond registration books maintained by the Trustee; provided, 
however, that the Holder of at least one million dollars ($1,000,000) in aggregate principal amount of Bonds may be 
paid by wire transfer to an account within the United States upon written request filed with the Trustee on or before 
the Record Date for the applicable Interest Payment Date.  Payment of the principal or redemption price of Bonds will 
be payable upon presentation and surrender of the Bonds at the corporate trust office of the Trustee. 

Redemption 

Special Redemption.  The Bonds are subject to redemption prior to their respective stated maturities, at the 
option of the Authority (which option shall be exercised upon Request of the Corporation, a copy of which Request 
shall be delivered to the Trustee not less than 25 days prior to the date fixed for such redemption, or such shorter 
period as agreed to in writing by the Trustee), in whole or in part (and, if in part, in such amounts, interest rates and 
maturities as may be specified by the Corporation and in Authorized Denominations), on any date specified by the 
Corporation, from hazard insurance or condemnation proceeds received with respect to the facilities of the Corporation 
and deposited in the Special Redemption Account, at the principal amount thereof, plus accrued interest to the date 
fixed for redemption, without premium. 

Optional Redemption.  The Bonds are subject to redemption prior to their respective stated maturities, at the 
option of the Authority (which option shall be exercised upon Request of the Corporation, a copy of which Request 
shall be delivered to the Trustee not less than 25 days prior to the date fixed for such redemption, or such shorter 
period as agreed to in writing by the Trustee), in whole or in part (and if in part, in such amounts, interest rates and 
maturities as may be specified by the Corporation and in Authorized Denominations, or, if the Corporation fails to 
specify such maturities, in inverse order of maturity) on any date on or after November 15, 2027, at a Redemption 
Price equal to 100% of the principal amount of Bonds called for redemption, plus accrued interest, if any, to the date

Selection of Bonds for Redemption.  Whenever provision is made in the Indenture for the redemption of less 
than all of the Bonds of any maturity or interest rate of Bonds, the Trustee shall select the Bonds to be redeemed, from 
all the Bonds subject to redemption or such given portion thereof equal to a multiple of Authorized Denominations, 
interest rate and maturity not previously called for redemption, by lot or in any manner which the Trustee in its sole 
discretion shall deem appropriate. 

Notice of Redemption.  Notice of redemption shall be given by the Trustee by first class mail, postage 
prepaid, not less than 20 days, nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, to the respective Holders of any 
the Bonds designated for redemption at their addresses appearing on the bond registration books of the Trustee.  Each 
notice of redemption shall be dated, shall identify the Bonds to be redeemed, shall state (i) the date of issue of the 
Bonds, (ii) the redemption date, (iii) the Redemption Price, (iv) the place or places where the Bonds being redeemed 
shall be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price (including the name and appropriate address or addresses 
of the Trustee), (v) the maturity date of the Bonds being redeemed, (vi) the CUSIP numbers, if any, and, in the case 
of the Bonds to be redeemed in part only, the respective portions of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.  Such 
notice shall also state that on the redemption date there will become due and payable on each of said the Bonds the 
Redemption Price thereof or of said specified portion of the principal amount thereof in the case of a Bond to be 
redeemed in part only, together with interest accrued thereon to the redemption date, and that from and after such 
redemption date, interest thereon shall cease to accrue, and shall require that such Bonds be then surrendered at the 
address or addresses of the Trustee specified in the redemption notice. 

Failure by the Trustee to mail notice of redemption pursuant to the Indenture to any one or more of the 
respective Holders of any Bonds designated for redemption shall not affect the validity or sufficiency of the 
proceedings for redemption with respect to the Holders to whom such notice was mailed.  Failure by the Trustee to 
mail notice of redemption to the Authority or any other Person shall not affect the validity or sufficiency of the 
proceedings for redemption. 

With respect to any notice of optional redemption of the Bonds, unless, upon the giving of such notice, such 
Bonds shall be deemed to have been paid pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, such notice shall state that such 
redemption shall be conditional upon the receipt by the Trustee on or prior to the date fixed for such redemption of 
amounts sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on, such Bonds to be redeemed, and that if such amounts shall 
not have been so received said notice shall be of no force and effect and the Authority shall not be required to redeem 
such Bonds and such failure to redeem such Bonds shall not constitute an Event of Default.  In the event that such 
notice of redemption contains such a condition and such amounts are not so received, the redemption shall not be 
made and the Trustee shall within a reasonable time thereafter give notice to the Holders to the effect that such amounts 
were not so received and such redemption was not made, such notice to be given by the Trustee in the same manner 
and to the same parties, as notice of such redemption was given pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture.  Such 
notice may also state other conditions to the optional redemption and if any other conditions are so stated, shall state 
that if such conditions shall not have been satisfied on or prior to the date fixed for redemption, said notice shall be of 
no force and effect and the Authority shall not be required to redeem such Bonds and such failure to redeem such 
Bonds shall not constitute an Event of Default.  In the event that such notice of optional redemption contains any such 
additional condition or conditions and such condition or conditions shall not have been satisfied on or prior to the date 



 6 

fixed for redemption, the redemption shall not be made and the Trustee shall within a reasonable time thereafter give 
notice to the Holders to the effect that such condition or conditions were not met and such redemption was not made, 
such notice to be given to the Trustee in the same manner and to the same parties as notice of such redemption was 
given pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture. 

Any notice given pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture described under this caption (other than a notice 
given in connection with a Mandatory Sinking Account Payment redemption) may be rescinded by written notice 
given to the Trustee by the Corporation no later than 4 Business Days prior to the date specified for redemption.  The 
Trustee shall give notice of such rescission as soon thereafter as practicable in the same manner, and to the same 
parties, as notice of such redemption was given pursuant to the Indenture. 

Effect of Redemption.  Notice of redemption having been duly given as aforesaid, and moneys for payment 
of the Redemption Price of, together with interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption on, the Bonds (or portions 
thereof) so called for redemption being held by the Trustee, on the date fixed for redemption designated in such notice, 
the Bonds (or portions thereof) so called for redemption shall become due and payable at the Redemption Price 
specified in such notice and interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption, interest on the Bonds so called 
for redemption shall cease to accrue, said the Bonds (or portions thereof) shall cease to be entitled to any benefit or 
security under the Indenture, and the Holders of said the Bonds shall have no rights in respect thereof except to receive 
payment of said Redemption Price and accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption from funds held by the Trustee 
for such payment. 

All the Bonds redeemed pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture and described in this section shall be 
cancelled and destroyed by the Trustee upon surrender thereof. 

Mandatory Purchase In Lieu of Redemption. 

Each Holder, by purchase and acceptance of any Bond, irrevocably grants to the Corporation the option to 
purchase such Bond, at any time such Bond is subject to optional redemption as provided in the Indenture, at a purchase 
price equal to the Redemption Price then applicable to such Bond.  In order to exercise such option, the Corporation 
shall deliver to the Trustee and the Authority a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel to the effect that such purchase, 
will not, in and of itself cause the interest on the Bonds to be included in gross income, and the Corporation shall 
direct the Trustee to provide notice of mandatory purchase, such notice to be provided, as and to the extent applicable, 
in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture described above under the caption “Notice of Redemption.”  On 
the date fixed for purchase of any Bond in lieu of redemption, the Corporation shall pay the purchase price of such 
Bond to the Trustee in immediately available funds and the Trustee shall pay the same to the Holders of Bonds being 
purchased against delivery thereof.  Following such purchase, the Trustee shall register such Bonds in accordance 
with the written instructions of the Corporation.  No purchase of any Bond in lieu of redemption shall operate to 
extinguish the indebtedness evidenced by such Bond.  No Holder may elect to retain a Bond subject to mandatory 
purchase in lieu of redemption. 

Book-Entry System 

The Bonds will be issued in book-entry form.  DTC will act as securities depository for the Bonds.  The 
Bonds will be issued as fully-registered securities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s partnership nominee).  
One fully-registered Bond will be issued for each maturity of the Bonds in the total aggregate principal amount of 
each such maturity and will be deposited with DTC.  See APPENDIX E – “BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM.” 

The Corporation and the Authority cannot and do not give any assurances that DTC will distribute to DTC 
Participants (as such term is defined in Appendix E) or that DTC Participants or others will distribute to the Beneficial 
Owners payments of principal of and interest on the Bonds or any redemption or other notices or that they will do so 
on a timely basis or will serve and act in the manner described in this Official Statement.  Neither the Corporation nor 
the Authority is responsible or liable for the failure of DTC or any DTC Participant or DTC Indirect Participant (as 
such term is defined in Appendix E) to make any payments or give any notice to a Beneficial Owner with respect to 
the Bonds or any error or delay relating thereto.

Notice to Bondholders 

All notices to Bondholders required by the Indenture will be deemed to have been sufficiently given or served 
for all purposes under the Indenture by being delivered by first-class mail, by overnight delivery or by email 
transmission, facsimile transmission or other electronic means of communication providing evidence of transmission, 
including a telephone communication confirmed by any of the aforementioned electronic methods. 

SECURITY AND SOURCE OF PAYMENT FOR THE BONDS 

General 

The Bonds are limited obligations of the Authority, payable solely from the Revenues pledged under the 
Indenture for such payment.  Revenues consist primarily of Loan Repayments made by the Corporation pursuant to 
the Loan Agreement in amounts sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the Bonds, when such become due.  
The Authority will assign its right, title, and interest in the Loan Agreement (except for any deposits to the Rebate 
Fund, the right to receive any administrative fees and expenses to the extent payable to the Authority, the right of the 
Authority to be reimbursed or indemnified pursuant thereto and the right to receive certain notices and opinions, to 
give consents or approvals and to make inspections) and in Obligation No. 39 to the Trustee.  The obligation of the 
Corporation to make the Loan Repayments will be evidenced and secured by Obligation No. 39.  See “—The Master 
Indenture” below. 

No reserve fund is being established in connection with the Bonds. 

The Master Indenture 

Joint and Several Obligations.  Currently, the Corporation is the sole Member of the Obligated Group.  
Under the Master Indenture, the Corporation, as Obligated Group Representative, may incur, for itself and on behalf 
of the other Members of the Obligated Group, Indebtedness, which may be evidenced and secured by Obligations 
issued under the Master Indenture.  All Members of the Obligated Group are jointly and severally liable with respect 
to the payment of each Obligation issued under the Master Indenture. 

Obligation No. 39 is being issued by the Corporation under and pursuant to the Master Indenture on a parity 
with all other Obligations issued or to be issued thereunder.  See “Outstanding Obligations Under the Master 
Indenture” below.  All Members of the Obligated Group are required to make payments on Obligation No. 39 in 
amounts sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the Bonds when due.  For a discussion of entry into or 
withdrawal from the Obligated Group, see APPENDIX C – “SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL DOCUMENTS—
MASTER INDENTURE—Covenants—Withdrawal from Obligated Group.” 

Outstanding Obligations Under the Master Indenture.  Upon the issuance of the Bonds and the Taxable 
Bonds, if issued, Obligations outstanding under the Master Indenture will secure (i) $1,863,915,000 in aggregate 
principal amount of indebtedness related to tax-exempt revenue and taxable bonds issued for the benefit of the 
Corporation, (ii) the Corporation’s obligations to make regularly scheduled payments and, in limited circumstances, 
settlement payments, under certain existing interest rate swap agreements and (iii) the Corporation’s obligations to 
make payments, under certain circumstances, to the financial institutions which have purchased certain revenue bonds 
issued for the benefit of the Corporation in prior direct placement transactions.  For a discussion of the interest rate 
swap agreements that the Corporation has entered into, see APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION CONCERNING 
STANFORD HEALTH CARE—SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION—Interest Rate Swap 
Arrangements.” 

Security for Obligations.  All Obligations issued and outstanding under the Master Indenture, including 
Obligation No. 39, which evidences and secures the Corporation’s obligations under the Loan Agreement, are secured 
by security interests in (i) the Gross Revenues of each Member of the Obligated Group and (ii) the moneys and 
investments on deposit from time to time in the Gross Revenue Fund created under the Master Indenture and held by 
the Master Trustee.  For a description of the limitations on the enforceability of the Master Indenture, see “SECURITY 



 8 

AND SOURCE OF PAYMENT FOR THE BONDS—Security and Enforceability—Risks Related to Master 
Indenture Financings; Fraudulent Transfer or Conveyance Statutes” herein. 

Security Interest in Gross Revenues.  Pursuant to the Master Indenture, the Corporation and each of the 
other Members of the Obligated Group, if any, grants a security interest in its Gross Revenues.  The security interest 
in Gross Revenues has been perfected to the extent the same may be perfected by filing under the California 
Commercial Code.  The California Commercial Code does not permit perfection by filing with respect to certain items 
included in Gross Revenues.  Under certain circumstances, the security interest in Gross Revenues may be 
subordinated to the interests of creditors other than the Holders of Obligations. 

The Gross Revenue Fund; Security Interest Therein.  Under the Master Indenture, the Corporation and each 
of the other Members of the Obligated Group, if any, are required to deposit daily all of the cash proceeds of the Gross 
Revenues with a depository bank or banks (collectively, a “Depository Bank”).  Subject to the provisions of the Master 
Indenture permitting the moneys in the Gross Revenue Fund to be used as provided therein, the Corporation and each 
of the other Members of the Obligated Group, if any, grants a security interest in the Gross Revenue Fund to the 
Master Trustee.  With certain exceptions, a security interest in the moneys in the Gross Revenue Fund may be perfected 
only if the moneys are held by the Master Trustee or its agent.  The Corporation, the Master Trustee and each 
Depository Bank are required to execute and have executed account control agreements (each, an “Account Control 
Agreement”) to create this agency relationship.  See APPENDIX C – “SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL 
DOCUMENTS—MASTER INDENTURE—Covenants—Gross Revenue Fund.” 

Additional Indebtedness.  The Corporation and each of the other Members of the Obligated Group, if any, 
are permitted under the Master Indenture to incur additional Indebtedness, either unsecured or secured by Permitted 
Liens, subject to the financial tests and limitations contained in the Master Indenture.  Additional Indebtedness need 
not be evidenced by Obligations issued under the Master Indenture.  However, only Indebtedness represented by 
Obligations will be secured by the security interests in Gross Revenues and the Gross Revenue Fund on a parity with 
other Obligations.  For a description of the financial tests and limits on additional indebtedness in the Master Indenture.  
See APPENDIX C – “SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL DOCUMENTS—MASTER INDENTURE—Covenants—
Limitations on Indebtedness.” 

Other Master Indenture Covenants.  In addition to the security and other provisions described above, the 
Master Indenture contains provisions, covenants and restrictions related to debt coverage, mergers, consolidations, 
sales and conveyances, dispositions of assets and other matters.  See APPENDIX C – “SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL 
DOCUMENTS—MASTER INDENTURE—Covenants.” 

Limitations on Enforceability.  There are circumstances under which it is possible that the Master Indenture 
would not be enforced by courts, especially as to future Members of the Obligated Group.  Also there are a number 
of circumstances under which the security interests, especially the security interest in Gross Revenues, may not be 
enforced or may be subordinated to the claims of others.  See “Security and Enforceability —Risks Related to Master 
Indenture Financings; Fraudulent Transfer or Conveyance Statutes,” “—Enforceability of the Loan Agreement” and 
“—Enforceability of Security Interests” herein. 

Replacement of Obligation No. 39. Obligation No. 39 will be surrendered by the Trustee and delivered to 
the Master Trustee for cancellation upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture, which include receipt by 
the Trustee of: (a) a Request of the Corporation requesting such surrender and delivery and stating that the Corporation 
has become a member of an obligated group (herein referred to as the "New Group") under a master indenture (other 
than the Master Indenture) (herein referred to as the "Replacement Master Indenture") and that an obligation is being 
issued to the Trustee under the Replacement Master Indenture; (b) a properly executed obligation (the "Replacement 
Obligation") issued under the Replacement Master Indenture and registered in the name of the Trustee with the same 
tenor and effect as Obligation No. 39 (in a principal amount equal to the then-Outstanding principal amount of Bonds), 
authenticated by the master trustee under the Replacement Master Indenture; (c) an Opinion of Counsel to the 
Corporation to the effect that the Replacement Obligation has been validly issued under the Replacement Master 
Indenture and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Corporation and each of the other members of the New 
Group; (d) a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel; (e) a copy of the Replacement Master Indenture, certified as a true 
and accurate copy by the master trustee under the Replacement Master Indenture; (f) written confirmation from each 
Rating Agency then rating the Bonds that the replacement of Obligation No. 39 will not, by itself, result in a reduction 



 9 

in the then-current ratings on the Bonds; and (g) a certificate of the Master Trustee to the effect that Obligation No. 
39 has been cancelled. 

Security and Enforceability 

Bankruptcy.  In the event of bankruptcy of the Corporation, the rights and remedies of the Bondholders are 
subject to various provisions of the federal Bankruptcy Code.  If the Corporation were to file a petition in bankruptcy, 
payments made by the Corporation during the 90 day (or perhaps one-year) period immediately preceding the filing 
of such petition may be avoidable as preferential transfers to the extent such payments allow the recipients thereof to 
receive more than they would have received in the event of such entity’s liquidation.  Security interests and other liens 
granted to a trustee, including the Trustee and the Master Trustee, and perfected during such preference period also 
may be avoided as preferential transfers to the extent such security interest or other lien secures obligations that arose 
prior to the date of such perfection.  Such a bankruptcy filing would operate as an automatic stay of the commencement 
or continuation of any judicial or other proceeding against the Corporation and its property and as an automatic stay 
of any act or proceeding to enforce a lien upon or to otherwise exercise control over such property, as well as various 
other actions to enforce, maintain or enhance the rights of a trustee.  If the bankruptcy court so ordered, the property 
of the Corporation, including accounts receivable and proceeds thereof, could be used for the financial rehabilitation 
of the Corporation despite any security interest of a trustee therein.  The rights of the Trustee to enforce its security 
interests and other liens could be delayed during the pendency of the rehabilitation proceeding. 

The Corporation could file a plan for the adjustment of its debts in any such proceeding, which could include 
provisions modifying or altering the rights of creditors generally or any class of them, secured or unsecured.  The plan, 
when confirmed by a court, binds all creditors who had notice or knowledge of the plan and, with certain exceptions, 
discharges all claims against the debtor to the extent provided for in the plan.  No plan may be confirmed unless certain 
conditions are met, among which are conditions that the plan be feasible and that it shall have been accepted by each 
class of claims impaired thereunder.  Each class of claims has accepted the plan if at least two-thirds in dollar amount 
and more than one-half in number of the class cast votes in its favor.  Even if the plan is not so accepted, it may be 
confirmed if the court finds that the plan is fair and equitable with respect to each class of non-accepting creditors 
impaired thereunder and does not discriminate unfairly. 

In addition, the obligations of the Corporation under the Loan Agreement are not secured by a lien on or 
security interest in any assets or revenues of the Corporation, other than the lien on Gross Revenues and in the funds 
on deposit in the Gross Revenue Fund as described herein under “SECURITY AND SOURCE OF PAYMENT FOR 
THE BONDS” securing all Obligations issued under the Master Indenture.  Except with respect to such lien on Gross 
Revenues, in the event of a bankruptcy of the Corporation, Bondholders would be unsecured creditors and would be 
in an inferior position to any secured creditors and on a parity with all other unsecured creditors. 

In the event of bankruptcy of the Corporation, there is no assurance that certain covenants, including tax 
covenants, contained in the Loan Agreement or other documents would survive.  Accordingly, a bankruptcy trustee 
could take action that would adversely affect the exclusion of interest on the Bonds from gross income for federal 
income tax purposes. 

Risks Related to Master Indenture Financings; Fraudulent Transfer or Conveyance Statutes.  On the date 
of issuance of the Bonds, the Corporation will be the only Member of the Obligated Group, and, consequently, the 
risks described below in this section would not apply.  However, should other institutions join the Obligated Group in 
the future, the risks described below would be relevant. 

The state of insolvency, fraudulent transfer or conveyance and bankruptcy laws relating to the enforceability 
of obligations of one corporation in favor of the creditors of another, or the obligation of one member of an obligated 
group to make debt service payments on behalf of another member or the ability of a corporate parent to compel its 
affiliates or subsidiaries to make such payments is unsettled.  The ability of the Master Trustee or the Corporation to 
compel one Member of the Obligated Group to make payment on behalf of another Member could be subject to 
challenge if such Member would, by make such payment, be rendered insolvent.  In particular, such efforts by the 
Master Trustee or the Corporation may not be enforced under the Federal Bankruptcy Code or applicable state 
fraudulent transfer or conveyance statutes if the obligation to pay is incurred without “fair consideration” or 
“reasonably equivalent value” to the obligor-Member and if the incurrence of the obligation renders the Member 



 10 

insolvent.  The standards for determining the fairness of consideration and the manner of determining insolvency are 
matters of judicial discretion based upon subjective standards and may vary under the Federal Bankruptcy Code and 
other statutes that may be applicable. 

In addition a court could determine, in the event of a bankruptcy of a Member, that payments made on 
Obligation No. 39 by a bankrupt Member could constitute payments to or for the benefit of an insider, within the 
meaning of Section 547(b) of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, which payments, if made within one year of the filing of 
the bankruptcy petition, might be recoverable by the bankruptcy court from the owners of the Bonds. 

If a court were to find that a Member did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the 
incurrence of the indebtedness evidenced by Obligation No. 39 and such Member: (i) was insolvent; (ii) was rendered 
insolvent by such incurrence; (iii) was engaged in a business activity for which its remaining assets were unreasonably 
small; or (iv) intended (or believed) to incur, assume or issue, debt beyond its ability to pay, a court could determine 
to invalidate, the indebtedness represented by Obligation No. 39. 

Enforceability of the Loan Agreement.  The legal right and practical ability of the Trustee to enforce rights 
and remedies under the Loan Agreement may be limited by laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, 
fraudulent conveyance or moratorium and by other similar laws affecting creditors’ rights.  In addition, enforcement 
of such rights and remedies will depend upon the exercise of various remedies specified by such documents, which, 
in many instances, may require judicial actions that are subject to discretion and delay, that otherwise may not be 
readily available or that may be limited by certain legal principles. 

There exists common law authority and authority under certain statutes for the ability of the courts to 
terminate the existence of a nonprofit corporation or undertake supervision of its affairs on various grounds, including 
a finding that such corporation has insufficient assets to carry out its stated charitable purposes.  Such court action 
may arise on the court’s own motion or pursuant to a petition of the State or such other persons who have interests 
different from those of the general public, pursuant to the common law and statutory power to enforce charitable trusts 
and to see to the application of their funds to their intended charitable uses. 

The various legal opinions delivered concurrently with the issuance of the Bonds are qualified as to the 
enforceability of the various legal instruments by limitations imposed by state and federal laws, rulings, policy and 
decisions affecting remedies and by bankruptcy, reorganization or other laws of general application affecting the 
enforcement of creditors’ rights or the enforceability of certain remedies or document provisions. 

Enforceability of Security Interests.  The security interest in Gross Revenues will be perfected to the extent, 
and only to the extent, that such security interest may be perfected under the California Commercial Code.  The 
foregoing grant of a security interest may be subordinated to the interest and claims of others in several instances.  
Some examples of cases of subordination of prior interests and claims are (i) statutory liens, (ii) rights arising in favor 
of the United States of America or any agency thereof, (iii) present or future prohibitions against assignment in any 
federal statutes or regulations, (iv) constructive trusts, equitable liens or other rights impressed or conferred by any 
state or federal court in the exercise of its equitable jurisdiction, and (v) federal or state bankruptcy laws that may 
affect the enforceability of the Master Indenture or grant of a security interest in Gross Revenues.  In addition, it may 
not be possible to perfect a security interest in any manner whatsoever in certain types of Gross Revenues (e.g., gifts, 
donations, certain insurance proceeds, Medicare and Medi-Cal payments) prior to actual receipt by the Corporation 
for deposit in the Gross Revenue Fund.  To the extent that funds of the Obligated Group are not on deposit in the 
Gross Revenue Fund, the owners of Obligations, including Obligation No. 39, have no security interest in such funds. 

Limited Liability of the Authority 

THE BONDS SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO CONSTITUTE A DEBT OR LIABILITY OF THE STATE 
OF CALIFORNIA OR OF ANY POLITICAL SUBDIVISION THEREOF, OTHER THAN THE AUTHORITY, OR 
A PLEDGE OF THE FAITH AND CREDIT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR OF ANY POLITICAL 
SUBDIVISION THEREOF, BUT SHALL BE PAYABLE SOLELY FROM THE FUNDS THEREFOR PROVIDED.  
NEITHER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOR THE AUTHORITY SHALL BE OBLIGATED TO PAY THE 
PRINCIPAL OR PURCHASE PRICE OF THE BONDS OR THE PREMIUM, IF ANY, OR THE INTEREST 
THEREON, EXCEPT FROM THE FUNDS PROVIDED UNDER THE LOAN AGREEMENT, OBLIGATION

CREDIT NOR THE TAXING POWER OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR OF ANY POLITICAL 
SUBDIVISION THEREOF IS PLEDGED TO THE PAYMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL OR PURCHASE PRICE OF 
THE BONDS OR THE PREMIUM, IF ANY, OR THE INTEREST ON THE BONDS.  THE ISSUANCE OF THE 
BONDS SHALL NOT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OR CONTINGENTLY OBLIGATE THE STATE OF 
CALIFORNIA OR ANY POLITICAL SUBDIVISION THEREOF TO LEVY OR TO PLEDGE ANY FORM OF 
TAXATION WHATEVER THEREFOR OR TO MAKE ANY APPROPRIATION FOR THEIR PAYMENT.  THE 
AUTHORITY HAS NO TAXING POWER. 

THE PLAN OF FINANCE 

The Bonds 

The Corporation anticipates the issuance of the Bonds in a total aggregate principal amount of $454,200,000 
for the purpose of advance refunding (i) $240,325,000 in aggregate principal amount of the California Health Facilities 
Financing Authority Refunding Revenue Bonds (Stanford Hospital and Clinics), Series 2008 Series A-1, A-2 and A-
3 (the “2008 Series Bonds”), currently outstanding in the total aggregate principal amount of $246,175,000, and (ii) 
$240,860,000 in aggregate principal amount of the California Health Facilities Financing Authority Refunding 
Revenue Bonds (Stanford Hospital and Clinics), 2010 Series A and B (the “2010 Series Bonds”), currently outstanding 
in the total aggregate principal amount of $260,185,000. The Corporation will pay all costs of issuance related to the 
Bonds, including underwriters’ compensation, from its internal funds. 

The Refunding Plan 

A portion of the proceeds of the Bonds, together with certain other funds, will be transferred to the trustee 
for the 2008 Series Bonds, as escrow agent, to be held in an irrevocable escrow fund established pursuant to an escrow 
agreement, in such an amount as will be sufficient to pay the regularly scheduled payments of principal of and interest 
on the 2008 Series Bonds to, and the redemption price of the 2008 Series Bonds on, their redemption date. 

A portion of the proceeds of the Bonds, together with certain other funds, will be transferred to the trustee 
for the 2010 Series Bonds, as escrow agent, to be held in an irrevocable escrow fund established pursuant to an escrow 
agreement, in such an amount as will be sufficient to pay the regularly scheduled payments of principal of and interest 
on the 2010 Series Bonds to, and the redemption price of the 2010 Series Bonds on, their redemption date. 

The Taxable Bonds 

The Taxable Bonds are expected to be issued in January 2018 and the proceeds thereof are expected to be 
used for general corporate purposes of the Corporation.

CONTINUING DISCLOSURE 

Because the Bonds are limited obligations of the Authority, payable solely from amounts received from the 
Corporation and future Members of the Obligated Group, if any, financial or operating data concerning the Authority 
is not material to an evaluation of the offering of the Bonds or to any decision to purchase, hold or sell the Bonds.  
Accordingly, the Authority has not provided any such information.  The Corporation, on behalf of the Obligated 
Group, has undertaken all responsibilities for any continuing disclosure to Holders of the Bonds, as described below, 
and the Authority has no liability to the Holders of the Bonds or any other person with respect to Rule 15c2-12 
promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Rule”). 

In connection with the issuance of the Bonds, the Corporation, on behalf of the Obligated Group, will enter 
into a continuing disclosure agreement (the “Continuing Disclosure Agreement”) with The Bank of New York Mellon 
Trust Company, N.A., acting as dissemination agent.  Pursuant to the Continuing Disclosure Agreement, the 
Corporation, for the benefit of Holders and Beneficial Owners of the Bonds, will agree to provide for dissemination: 
(i) certain financial information and operating data relating to the Obligated Group by not later than 150 days 
following the end of the Corporation’s fiscal year (which currently is August 31) (the “Annual Report”), commencing 
with the report for the 2017 Fiscal Year (due January 28, 2018), and (ii) notices of the occurrence of certain 
enumerated events, as required by the Rule.  The Annual Report and the notices of material events will be filed by the 
Corporation, in readable PDF or other acceptable electronic form, with the Electronic Municipal Market Access 
system (“EMMA”) of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (the “MSRB”).  See APPENDIX F – “FORM OF 
CONTINUING DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT” for the specific nature of the information to be contained in the 
Annual Report and the notices of material events.  These covenants have been made in order to assist the Underwriters 
in complying with the Rule. 

The Corporation additionally has covenanted that it will file with EMMA, not later than 60 days after the end 
of each fiscal quarter (except the fourth fiscal quarter), certain unaudited financial information for the Obligated Group 
for such fiscal quarter prepared by the Corporation.  See APPENDIX F – “FORM OF CONTINUING DISCLOSURE 
AGREEMENT.” 

All the required information in accordance with the Rule with respect to the outstanding bonds issued for the 
benefit of the Corporation has been provided to the MSRB.  In the last five years, the 2012 Annual Report that the 
Corporation had timely filed with the dissemination agent was not posted by the dissemination agent within the 
timeframe required under the related continuing disclosure agreement.  With respect to the Quarterly Report for the 
fiscal quarter ending November 30, 2016, and with respect to one event notice involving rating upgrades, filings were 
not posted by the dissemination agent within the timeframe required under the related continuing disclosure 
agreements. For the 2016 Annual Report and the Quarterly Reports for the fiscal years 2016 and 2017, the Corporation 
intends to correct certain short stay outpatient days information as soon as practicable and no later than by the date of 
delivery of the Bonds.   

BONDHOLDERS’ RISKS 

The purchase of the Bonds involves investment risks that are discussed throughout this Official Statement.  
Prospective purchasers of the Bonds should evaluate all of the information presented in this Official Statement.  This 
section on Bondholders’ Risks focuses primarily on the general risks associated with hospital or health system 
operations, whereas Appendix A describes the Corporation specifically.  These should be read together. 

General 

Except as noted under “SECURITY AND SOURCE OF PAYMENT FOR THE BONDS,” the Bonds are 
payable from Loan Repayments made pursuant to the Loan Agreement and from funds provided under Obligation No. 
39 and the Indenture.  No representation or assurance can be made that revenues will be realized by the 
Corporation in amounts sufficient to make the Loan Repayments and hence the debt service on the Bonds. 

The Corporation is subject to a wide variety of federal and state regulatory actions and legislative and policy 
changes by those governmental and private agencies that administer Medicare, Medicaid and other payors and is 



 15 

subject to actions by, among others, the National Labor Relations Board, The Joint Commission, the Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”), the 
Attorney General of the State of California (the “State”), and other federal, state and local government agencies.  The 
future financial condition of the Obligated Group could be adversely affected by, among other things, changes in the 
method, timing and amount of payments to the Obligated Group by governmental and nongovernmental payors, the 
financial viability of these payors, increased competition from other health care entities, the costs associated with 
responding to governmental audits, inquiries and investigations, demand for health care, other forms of care or 
treatment, changes in the methods by which employers purchase health care for employees, capability of management, 
changes in the structure of how health care is delivered and paid for (e.g., accountable care organizations (“ACOs”), 
value based purchasing, bundled payments and other health reform payment mechanisms, including a “single-payor” 
system), future changes in the economy, demographic changes, availability of physicians, nurses and other health care 
professionals, and malpractice claims and other litigation.  These factors and others may adversely affect payment by 
the Corporation and any future Member of the Obligated Group under the Loan Agreement and Obligation No. 39 
and, consequently, on the Bonds.  In addition, the tax-exempt status of the Corporation and any future Obligated Group 
Member and, therefore, of the Bonds, could be adversely affected by, among other things, an adverse determination 
by a governmental entity, noncompliance with governmental regulations or legislative changes, including changes 
resulting from current health care reform legislation or initiatives.  See “—Health Care Reform” and “—Tax-Exempt 
Status and Other Tax Matters” below. 

Significant Risk Areas Summarized 

Certain of the primary risks associated with the operations of hospitals and health systems similar to those 
operated by the Corporation are briefly summarized in general terms below and are explained in greater detail in 
subsequent sections.  The occurrence of one or more of these risks could have a material adverse effect on the financial 
condition and results of operations of the Corporation or any future Member of the Obligated Group and, in turn, the 
ability of the Obligated Group to make payments under the Loan Agreement and Obligation No. 39. 

Federal Health Care Reform and Deficit Reduction.  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as 
enacted in March 2010 and as subsequently amended (the “ACA”), impacts almost all aspects of hospital and provider 
operations and health care delivery, and has changed and is changing how health care services are covered, delivered, 
and reimbursed.  These changes have resulted in new payment models with the risk of lower hospital reimbursement 
from Medicare, utilization changes, increased government enforcement and the necessity for health care providers to 
assess, and potentially alter, their business strategy and practices, among other consequences.  It is unclear how efforts 
to repeal the legislation and lawsuits to challenge its provisions will be resolved.  Uncertainties regarding 
implementation of the ACA create unpredictability for the strategic and business planning efforts of health care 
providers, which in itself creates risk.  Requirements for state “health information exchanges” could fundamentally 
alter the health insurance market by giving the health information exchanges a rate-setting role, negatively impacting 
hospital providers. 

In recent years, federal policymakers have undertaken various efforts to reduce the federal deficit, principally 
by reducing federal spending on entitlement programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.  Additional attempts to curb 
federal entitlement program spending are likely, and federal deficit reduction efforts would likely curb federal 
Medicare and Medicaid spending further to the detriment of hospitals, physicians and other health care providers.  
From time to time, there may be legislative or judicial efforts to repeal or substantially modify provisions of the ACA.  
See “—Health Care Reform” below. 

Tax Reform.  Tax legislation, administrative actions taken by tax authorities, or court decisions, whether at 
the federal or state level, may adversely affect the tax-exempt status of interest on the Bonds under federal or state 
law or otherwise prevent beneficial owners of the Bonds from realizing the full current benefit of the tax status of such 
interest.  In addition, such legislation or actions (whether currently proposed, proposed in the future, or enacted) and 
such decisions could affect the market price or marketability of the Bonds.    In particular, legislation is currently 
pending in Congress which, if enacted, would significantly change the income tax rates for individuals and 
corporations and would repeal the alternative minimum tax for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017.  It is not 
possible to predict whether this legislation will be enacted and, if so, what provisions it will contain. 



 16 

Rate Pressure from Insurers and Purchasers.  Certain health care markets, including many communities in 
California, are strongly impacted by large health insurers and, in some cases, by major purchasers of health services.  
In those areas, health insurers may have significant influence over the rates, utilization and competition of hospitals 
and other health care providers.  Rate pressure imposed by health insurers or other major purchasers, including 
managed care payers, may have a material adverse impact on health care providers, particularly if major purchasers 
put increasing pressure on payers to restrain rate increases.  Business failures by health insurers also could have a 
material adverse impact on contracted hospitals and other health care providers in the form of payment shortfalls or 
delay, and/or continuing obligations to care for managed care patients without receiving payment.  In addition, disputes 
with non-contracted payers may result in an inability to collect billed charges from these payers. 

Medicare.  Inpatient hospitals rely to a high degree on payment from the federal Medicare program, and 
future payment changes are predicted.  Recent, as well as future, changes in the underlying law and regulations, as 
well as in payment policy and timing, create uncertainty and could have a material adverse impact on hospitals’ 
payment streams from Medicare.  With health care and hospital spending reported to be increasing faster than the rate 
of general inflation, Congress and CMS may take action in the future to decrease or change Medicare outlays for 
hospitals and physicians. 

General Economic Conditions, Bad Debt, Indigent Care and Investment Performance.  Health care 
providers are economically influenced by the environment in which they operate.  Any national economic difficulties 
may constrain corporate and personal spending, limit the availability of credit and increase the national debt and 
federal and certain state government deficits.  To the extent that unemployment rates are high, employers reduce their 
workforces and their budgets for employee health care coverage, or private and public insurers seek to reduce 
payments to health care providers or curb utilization of health care services, health care providers may experience 
decreases in insured patient volume and reductions in payments for services.  In addition, to the extent that state, 
county or city governments are unable to provide a safety net of medical services, pressure is applied to local health 
care providers to increase free care.  Economic downturns and lower funding of federal Medicare and state Medicaid 
and other state health care programs may increase the number of patients who are unable to pay for some or all of 
their medical and hospital services.  These conditions may give rise to increases in health care providers’ uncollectible 
accounts, or “bad debt,” uninsured discount and charity care and, consequently, to reductions in operating income.  
Declines in investment portfolio values may reduce or eliminate non-operating revenues.  Investment losses (even if 
unrealized) may trigger debt covenant violations and may jeopardize hospitals’ economic security.  Losses in pension 
and other postretirement benefit funds may result in increased funding requirements for hospitals and health systems.  
Potential failure of lenders, insurers or vendors may negatively impact the results of operations and the overall 
financial condition of health care providers.  Philanthropic support may also decrease or be delayed.  These factors 
may have a material adverse impact on hospitals and health care providers.  For a discussion of these risks with regard 
to the Corporation, in particular the Corporation’s recent results of operations and statement of financial position and 
performance of the Corporation’s investments, see APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION CONCERNING STANFORD 
HEALTH CARE—SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION.” 

Interest Rate Swaps and Hedge Risk.  Interest rate swaps have experienced, from time to time, negative 
trading patterns, causing many to cease to function effectively to hedge interest rate exposure.  Some swap 
counterparties have ceased to exist and others have suffered repeated downgrading and negative market perception.  
Further, certain swap arrangements may not be terminable except upon the payment of termination fees by the 
borrowing party, which may be substantial in amount.  In the interim, negative mark-to-market valuation of certain 
swap arrangements must be recorded on a borrower’s balance sheet.  These factors may have a material adverse impact 
on hospitals and health systems involved in such financial arrangements.  For a discussion of the interest rate swap 
agreements that the Corporation has entered into, see APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION CONCERNING 
STANFORD HEALTH CARE—SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION—Interest Rate Swap 
Arrangements.” 

Debt Limit Increase.  Through legislation, the federal government has created a debt “ceiling” or limit on 
the amount of debt that may be issued by the United States Treasury.  In the past several years, political disputes have 
arisen within the federal government in connection with discussions concerning the authorization for an increase in 
the federal debt ceiling.  Any failure by Congress to increase the federal debt limit may impact the federal 
government’s ability to incur additional debt, pay its existing debt instruments and to satisfy its obligations relating to 
the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 



 17 

Management of the Corporation is unable to determine at this time what impact any future failure to increase 
the federal debt limit may have on the operations and financial condition of the Corporation, although such impact 
may be material.  Additionally, the market price or marketability of the Bonds in the secondary market may be 
materially adversely impacted by any failure to increase the federal debt limit. 

Nonprofit Health Care Environment.  The significant tax benefits received by nonprofit, tax-exempt 
hospitals have increasingly caused the business practices of such hospitals to be subject to scrutiny by public officials 
and the press, and to political and legal challenges of the ongoing qualification of such organizations for tax-exempt 
status.  Multiple governmental authorities, including Congress, the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), state 
attorneys general, and state legislatures have held hearings and carried out audits regarding the conduct of tax-exempt 
organizations, including tax-exempt hospitals.  Citizen organizations, such as labor unions and patient advocates, have 
also focused public attention on the activities of tax-exempt hospitals and health systems and raised questions about 
their practices.  The IRS imposes certain reporting requirements on hospitals and health systems, including through 
Schedule H, Schedule J and Schedule K of the IRS Form 990 (“Form 990”).  Proposals to stiffen the regulatory 
requirements for nonprofit hospitals’ retention of tax-exempt status, such as by establishing a minimum level of charity 
care, have also been introduced repeatedly in Congress.  These challenges and examinations, and any resulting 
legislation, regulations, judgments or penalties, could materially change the operating environment for nonprofit 
providers and have a material adverse effect on the Corporation.  Significant changes in the obligations of nonprofit, 
tax-exempt hospitals and challenges to or loss of the tax-exempt status of nonprofit hospitals generally, or the 
Corporation in particular, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation.  See “—Tax-Exempt Status and 
Other Tax Matters—Maintenance of Tax-Exempt Status of Interest on the Bonds” below. 

Capital Needs vs. Capital Capacity.  Hospital and other health care operations are capital intensive.  
Regulation, technology and expectations of physicians and patients require constant and often significant capital 
investment.  In California, seismic safety standards mandated by the State may require that many hospital facilities be 
substantially modified, replaced or closed.  Nearly all hospitals in California are affected.  Estimated construction 
costs are substantial and actual costs of compliance may exceed estimates.  Total capital needs may exceed capital 
capacity.  Furthermore, capital capacity of hospitals and health systems may be reduced as a result of any credit market 
dislocations. 

Construction Risks.  Construction projects are subject to a variety of risks, including but not limited to delays 
in issuance of required building permits or other necessary approvals or permits, including environmental approvals, 
strikes, shortages of materials and labor, and adverse weather conditions.  Such events could delay occupancy.  Cost 
overruns may occur due to change orders, delays in the construction schedule, scarcity of building materials and labor 
and other factors.  Cost overruns could cause the costs to exceed available funds.  See APPENDIX A – 
“INFORMATION CONCERNING STANFORD HEALTH CARE—SERVICES, FACILITIES AND 
OPERATIONS—SHC’s Long-Range Master Plan and Additional Capital Needs.” 

Government “Fraud” Enforcement.  “Fraud” in government funded health care programs is of significant 
concern to the federal government and state regulatory agencies overseeing health care programs, and is one of the 
federal government’s prime law enforcement priorities.  The federal government and, to a lesser degree, state 
governments impose a wide variety of extraordinarily complex and technical requirements intended to prevent over-
utilization based on economic inducements, misallocation of expenses, overcharging and other forms of “fraud” in the 
Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as other state and federally-funded health care programs.  This body of 
regulation impacts a broad spectrum of hospital and other health care provider commercial activity, including 
licensing, billing, accounting, recordkeeping, medical staff oversight, medical necessity determinations, quality 
assurance, physician contracting and recruiting, cost allocation, clinical trials, discounts and other functions and 
transactions. 

Violations and alleged violations may be deliberate, but also frequently occur in circumstances where 
management is unaware of the conduct in question, as a result of mistake, or where the individual participants do not 
know that their conduct is in violation of law.  Violations may occur and be prosecuted in circumstances that do not 
have the traditional elements of fraud, and enforcement actions may extend to conduct that occurred in the past.  
Violations may carry significant sanctions.  The government periodically conducts widespread investigations covering 
categories of services or certain accounting, coding or billing practices. 



 18 

Violations and Sanctions.  The government and/or private “whistleblowers” often pursue aggressive 
investigative and enforcement actions.  The government has a wide array of civil, criminal, monetary and other 
penalties, including suspending essential hospital and other health care provider payments from the Medicare or 
Medicaid programs, or exclusion from those programs.  Aggressive investigation tactics, negative publicity and 
threatened penalties can be, and often are, used to force settlements, payment of fines and compliance with prospective 
restrictions that may have a materially adverse impact on hospital and other health care provider operations, financial 
condition, results of operations and reputation.  Multi-million dollar fines and settlements for alleged intentional 
misconduct, fraud or false claims are not uncommon in the health care industry.  These risks are generally uninsured.  
Government enforcement and private whistleblower suits may continue to increase in the hospital and health care 
sector.  Many large hospital and other health care provider systems are likely to be adversely impacted by actions or 
claims of this kind. 

Personnel Shortage.  From time to time, shortages of physicians and nursing and other technical personnel 
occur, which may impact hospitals and health care systems.  Various studies have predicted that physician and nurse 
shortages will become more acute over time, as practitioners retire and patient volume exceeds the growth in new 
professionals.  As reimbursement amounts are reduced to health care facilities and organizations that employ or 
contract with physicians, nurses and other health care professionals, pressure to control and possibly reduce wage and 
benefit costs may further strain the supply of those professionals.  In California, regulation of nurse staff ratios can 
intensify the potential shortage of nursing personnel.  In addition, shortages of other professional and technical staff 
such as pharmacists, therapists, laboratory technicians, billing coders and others may occur or worsen.  Hospital 
operations, patient and physician satisfaction, financial condition and future growth could be negatively affected by 
physician and nursing and other technical personnel shortages, resulting in material adverse impact to hospitals and 
health care systems. 

Technical and Clinical Developments.  New clinical techniques and technology, as well as new 
pharmaceutical and genetic developments and products, may alter the course of medical diagnosis and treatment in 
ways that are currently unanticipated, and that may dramatically change medical and hospital care.  These 
developments could result in higher health care costs, significant capital investments, reductions in patient 
populations, lower utilization of hospital service and/or new sources of competition for hospitals. 

Costs and Restrictions from Governmental Regulation.  Nearly every aspect of hospital operations and 
health care delivery is regulated, in some cases by multiple agencies of government.  The level and complexity of 
regulation and compliance audits appear to be increasing, imposing greater operational limitations, higher staffing and 
training requirements, enforcement and liability risks, and significant and sometimes unanticipated costs. 

Proliferation of Competition.  Hospitals increasingly face competition from specialty providers of care and 
ambulatory care facilities.  This competition may cause hospitals to lose essential inpatient or outpatient market share.  
Competition may be focused on services or payor classifications where hospitals realize their highest margins, thus 
negatively affecting programs that are economically important to hospitals.  Specialty hospitals may treat only 
profitable classifications of patients, leaving full-service hospitals with higher acuity and/or lower paying patient 
populations.  These new sources of competition may have a material adverse impact on hospitals, particularly where 
a group of a hospital’s principal physician admitters may curtail their use of a hospital service in favor of a competitor’s 
facilities. 

Increasing Consumer Choice.  Hospitals and other health care providers face increased pressure to be 
transparent and provide information about cost and quality of services, which may lead to a loss of business as 
consumers and others make choices about where to receive health care services based upon publicly available 
information. 

Labor Costs and Disruption.  The delivery of health care services is labor intensive.  Labor costs, including 
salary, benefits and other liabilities associated with the workforce, have significant impact on hospital and health care 
provider operations and financial condition.  Hospital and health care employees are increasingly organized in 
collective bargaining units and may be involved in work actions of various kinds, including work stoppages and 
strikes.  Overall costs of the hospital workforce are high, and turnover is high.  Pressure to recruit, train and retain 
qualified employees is expected to accelerate.  These factors may materially increase hospital costs of operation.  At 
the same time, health care organizations will be under increasing pressure to reduce the cost of delivering care to 



 19 

patients, including the cost of salary and benefits, in order to compete in a transparent price market.  Workforce 
disruption may negatively impact hospital revenues and reputation.  See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION 
CONCERNING STANFORD HEALTH CARE—EMPLOYEES.” 

Pension and Benefit Funding.  As large employers, hospitals and health care providers may incur significant 
expenses to fund pension and benefit plans for employees and former employees, and to fund required workers’ 
compensation benefits.  Plans are often underfunded or may become underfunded, and funding obligations, in some 
cases, may be erratic or unanticipated and may require significant commitments of available cash needed for other 
purposes. 

Organizations that are controlled by or under common control with other entities may be jointly and severally 
liable for the defined benefit pension plan obligations of these entities, by virtue of the “controlled group” rules under 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 
1974, as amended.  To the extent that a plan sponsor is unable to or does not meet the plan’s minimum funding 
standards or if there are unfunded liabilities upon plan termination, members of the controlled group are jointly and 
severally liable, and any excise tax applicable to the unpaid required minimum funding contributions can be levied 
against the controlled group.  The rules permit the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (“PBGC”), the federal 
agency charged with insuring and monitoring defined benefit plans, to impose a lien on the controlled group if required 
minimum funding contributions and unpaid amounts total more than $1 million.  The PBGC also has the authority to 
recover from the members of the plan sponsor’s controlled group amounts that the PBGC pays, or assumes the 
obligation to pay, to plan participants and beneficiaries in connection with a termination of an underfunded plan.  The 
PBGC may also attach a lien to the assets of the plan sponsor’s controlled group members to secure its claims for 
recovery. 

The Corporation sponsors a defined benefit pension plan, which is frozen to new participants, and has other 
pension-related obligations with respect to its workforce.  The Corporation is also a member of a controlled group that 
sponsors two additional defined benefit plans.  See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION CONCERNING STANFORD 
HEALTH CARE—SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION–Management’s Discussion and Analysis of 
Recent Financial Performance–Pension Funding Requirements.” 

Medical Liability Litigation and Insurance.  Medical liability litigation is subject to public policy 
determinations and legal and procedural rules that may be altered from time to time, with the result that the frequency 
and cost of such litigation, and resultant liabilities or insurance costs, may increase in the future.  Hospitals and health 
care providers may be affected by negative financial and liability impacts on physicians.  Costs of insurance, including 
self-insurance, may increase dramatically. 

Facility Damage.  Hospitals and health care providers are highly dependent on the condition and 
functionality of their physical facilities.  Damage from earthquakes, floods, fires, other natural causes, deliberate acts 
of destruction, or various facilities system failures may have a material adverse impact on operations, financial 
conditions and results of operations. 

Nonprofit Health Care Environment 

The tax-exempt status afforded nonprofit health care organizations is the subject of increasing regulatory and 
legislative threats.  As a nonprofit tax-exempt organization, the Corporation is subject to federal, state and local laws, 
regulations, rulings and court decisions relating to its organization and operation, including its operation for charitable 
purposes.  At the same time, the Corporation conducts large-scale complex business transactions and is a major 
employer in its geographic area.  There can often be a tension between the rules designed to regulate a wide range of 
charitable organizations and the day-to-day operations of a complex health care organization.  Hospitals or other health 
care providers may be forced to forgo otherwise favorable opportunities for certain joint ventures, recruitment and 
other arrangements in order to maintain their tax-exempt status. 

The operations and practices of nonprofit, tax-exempt hospitals are routinely challenged or criticized for 
inconsistency or inadequate compliance with the regulatory requirements for, and societal expectations of, nonprofit 
tax-exempt organizations.  These challenges, in some cases, are broader than concerns about compliance with federal 
and state statutes and regulations, such as Medicare and Medicaid compliance, and instead in many cases are 



 20 

examinations of core business practices of the health care organizations.  A common theme of these challenges is 
whether nonprofit hospitals may not confer community benefits that exceed or equal the benefit received from their 
tax-exempt status.  Areas that have come under examination have included pricing practices, billing and collection 
practices, charitable care, methods of providing and reporting community benefit, executive compensation, exemption 
of property from real property taxation, private use of facilities financed with tax-exempt bonds and others.  These 
challenges and questions have come from a variety of sources, including state attorneys general, the IRS, local and 
state tax authorities, labor unions, Congress, state legislatures and patients, and in a variety of forums, including 
hearings, audits and litigation.  The challenges and examinations, and any resulting legislation, regulations, judgments 
or penalties, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation. 

Congressional Hearings.  A number of House and Senate Committees, including the House 
Committee on Energy and Commerce, the House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee 
on Finance, have conducted hearings and/or investigations into issues related to nonprofit tax-exempt health 
care organizations.  These hearings and investigations have included a nationwide investigation of hospital 
billing and collection practices, charity care and community benefit and prices charged to uninsured patients 
and possible reforms to the nonprofit sector.  These hearings and investigations may result in new legislation. 

Nonprofit Legislation. Legislative proposals that could have an adverse effect on the Corporation 
include: (i) any changes in the taxation of nonprofit corporations or in the scope of their exemption from 
income or property taxes; (ii) limitations on the amount or availability of tax-exempt financing for 
corporations recognized as tax-exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the Code; (iii) regulatory limitations 
affecting the Corporation’s ability to undertake capital projects or develop new services; (iv) a requirement 
that nonprofit health care institutions pay real property tax and sales tax on the same basis as for-profit 
entities; (v) mandates to provide certain levels of free or substantially reduced care that must be provided to 
low income uninsured and underinsured populations; and (vi) placing ceilings on executive compensation. 

Tax-Exempt Bond Examinations.  IRS officials have indicated that resources will be invested in 
audits of tax-exempt bonds in the charitable organization sector with specific review of private use.  Bonds 
issued for the benefit of the Corporation have been audited in the past.  Schedule K of Form 990 requires tax-
exempt organizations to report on the investment and use of tax-exempt bond proceeds to address IRS 
concerns regarding compliance with arbitrage rebate requirements and the private use of bond-financed 
facilities.  

IRS Examination of Compensation Practices and Community Benefit.  The IRS has been 
historically concerned about executive compensation practices of tax-exempt hospitals.  In 2004, the IRS 
began a compliance program to measure compliance by tax-exempt organizations with requirements that 
they not pay excessive compensation and benefits to their officers and other insiders.  In February 2009, the 
IRS issued its Hospital Compliance Project Final Report (the “IRS Final Report”) that examined tax-exempt 
organizations’ practices and procedures with regard to compensation and benefits paid to their officers and 
other defined “insiders.”  The IRS Final Report indicated that the IRS will continue to heavily scrutinize 
executive compensation arrangements, practices and procedures of tax-exempt hospitals and other tax-
exempt organizations and, in certain circumstances, may conduct further investigations or impose fines on 
tax-exempt organizations. 

The IRS has also undertaken a community benefit initiative directed at hospitals.  The IRS Final 
Report determined that the reporting of community benefit by nonprofit hospitals varied widely, both as to 
types of programs and expenditures classified as community benefit and the measurement of community 
benefits.  Form 990 requires detailed disclosure of compensation practices, corporate governance, loans to 
management and others, joint ventures and other types of transactions, political campaign activities, and other 
areas the IRS deems to be a compliance risk.  The Form 990 also requires the disclosure of information on 
community benefit as well as reporting of information related to tax-exempt bonds, including compliance 
with the arbitrage rules and rules limiting private-use of bond-financed facilities, including compliance with 
the safe harbor guidance in connection with management contracts and research contracts.  The Form 990 is 
intended to provide enhanced transparency as to the operations of exempt organizations.  See “—Tax-Exempt 
Status and Other Tax Matters” below. 



 21 

Revisions to Form 990, Schedule H.  As described below in “—Tax-Exempt Status and Other Tax 
Matters” the ACA contains new requirements for tax-exempt hospitals through Section 501(r) of the Code.  
Schedule H of Form 990, which hospitals must use to report their community benefit activities, has been 
revised to require details on how a hospital determines eligibility for free or discounted care (if the federal 
poverty guidelines are not used). Consistent with Section 501(r) of the Code, Schedule H now requires 
hospitals to describe billing and collection practices permitted under the hospital facility’s policies, as well 
as information about the hospital’s emergency medical care policy, financial assistance policy, and 
community health needs assessments.  Hospitals must complete all of Schedule H, including lines that relate 
to community health needs assessments. 

Litigation Relating to Billing and Collection Practices.  Lawsuits have been filed in both federal 
and state courts alleging, among other things, that hospitals have failed to fulfill their obligations to provide 
charity care to uninsured patients and have overcharged uninsured patients.  Some of these cases have since 
been dismissed by the courts and some hospitals and health systems have entered into substantial settlements.  
Cases are pending in various courts around the country and others could be filed. 

California Attorney General.  California nonprofit public benefit corporations, including the 
Corporation, are subject to oversight and examination by the State Attorney General to ensure that their 
charitable purposes are being carried out, that their fundraising and investment activities comply with State 
law and that the terms of charitable gifts are followed. 

California Auditor Investigation of Exempt Status of Nonprofit Hospitals.  In August 2011, 
California’s Joint Legislative Audit Committee directed the California Bureau of State Audits to investigate 
whether the State’s nonprofit hospitals are providing enough charity care and community benefit to justify 
their tax-exempt status.  A report was issued in August 2012 that summarized the findings and recommended 
that the California Legislature (i) amend state law to include requirements with respect to the amount of 
community benefits a hospital provides, (ii) define a standard methodology for calculating the community 
benefits a hospital delivers, and (iii) amend state law to allow assessment of a penalty against hospitals that 
are not in compliance with submitting community benefit plans to the Office of Statewide Health Planning 
and Development (“OSHPD”).  See “—Tax-Exempt Status and Other Tax Matters” below. 

Financial Assistance and Charity Care.  California law requires hospitals to maintain written 
policies about discount payment and charity care and provide copies of such policies to patients and OSHPD.  
California law also requires hospitals to follow specific billing and debt collection procedures and 
communicate proactively through the entire cycle of care to patients on the options available to them within 
the policies.  The Corporation has adopted and maintains such policies. 

Indigent Care.  Tax-exempt health care providers often treat large numbers of indigent patients who 
are unable to pay in full for their medical care.  Typically, urban, inner-city hospitals and other health care 
providers may treat significant numbers of indigents.  These hospitals and health care providers may be 
susceptible to economic and political changes that could increase the number of indigents or their 
responsibility for caring for this population.  General economic conditions may affect the number of 
employed individuals who have health coverage and the ability of those individuals to pay for their health 
care.  Similarly, changes in governmental policy, which may result in coverage exclusions under local, 
county, state and federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) may increase the frequency 
and severity of indigent treatment by such hospitals and other providers.  It also is possible that future 
legislation could require that tax-exempt hospitals and other providers maintain minimum levels of indigent 
care as a condition to federal tax exemption or exemption from certain state or local taxes. 

Challenges to Real Property Tax Exemptions.  The real property tax exemptions afforded to certain 
nonprofit health care providers by state and local taxing authorities have been challenged in certain 
circumstances on the assertion that the health care providers were not engaged in sufficient charitable 
activities.  These challenges have been based on a variety of grounds, including allegations of aggressive 
billing and collection practices, excessive financial margins and operations that closely resemble for-profit 
businesses. 



 22 

The foregoing are some examples of the challenges and examinations facing nonprofit health care 
organizations.  They are indicative of a greater scrutiny of the billing, collection and other business practices of these 
organizations and may indicate an increasingly difficult operating environment for health care organizations, including 
the Corporation.  The challenges and examinations, and any resulting legislation, regulations, judgments, or penalties, 
could have a material adverse effect on hospitals and health care providers, including the Corporation, and, in turn, its 
ability to make payments under the Loan Agreement and Obligation No. 39. 

Federal Budget Cuts 

The Budget Control Act of 2011 mandates significant reductions and spending caps on the federal budget for 
fiscal years 2012–2021, including a reduction of 2% on all Medicare payments during this period.  Subsequent 
legislation enacted by Congress extended these reductions through 2025.  There is a substantial risk that Congress will 
act to extend or increase these across-the-board reductions. 

Because Congress may make changes to the budget in the future, it is impossible to predict the impact any 
spending cuts may have upon the Corporation.  Similarly, it is impossible to predict whether any automatic reductions 
to Medicare may be triggered in lieu of other spending cuts that may be proposed by Congress.  If and to the extent 
Medicare and/or Medicaid spending is reduced under either scenario, this may have a material adverse effect upon the 
financial condition of the Corporation.  Ultimately, these reductions or alternatives could have a disproportionate 
impact on hospital providers and could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Corporation. 

Health Care Reform 

The discussion herein describes risks associated with certain existing federal and State laws, regulations, 
rules, and governmental administrative policies and determinations to which the Corporation and the health care 
industry are subject.  While these are regularly subject to change, many of the existing provisions were enacted by or 
promulgated pursuant to the ACA, to which opposition has been expressed by President Trump and the Secretary of 
DHHS, as well as the majority leaders of each chamber of Congress and members of their caucuses.  It is not possible 
to predict with any certainty whether or when the ACA or any specific provision or implementing measure will be 
repealed, withdrawn or modified in any significant respect, but a unified administration and majority in both chambers 
of Congress could enact legislation, withdraw, modify or promulgate rules, regulations and policies, or make 
determinations affecting the Corporation, any of which individually or collectively could have a material adverse 
effect on the operations, financial condition and financial performance of the Corporation. 

President Trump and certain Congressional leaders have included a repeal of all or a portion of the ACA in 
statements concerning their respective legislative agendas, and Congress has taken steps to repeal and replace parts of 
the ACA.  The repeal effort, to date, has focused on individual and employer mandates, exchanges, insurance industry 
regulations, Medicaid expansion, and the taxes to pay for these elements of the ACA.  If a repeal in whole or in part 
were to occur, it is unclear when or if a replacement plan would be implemented.  A repeal could result in additional 
pressure on Medicaid and Medicare funding and could have the effect of reducing the availability of health insurance 
to individuals who were previously insured, resulting in greater numbers of uninsured individuals, and could otherwise 
materially adversely affect the Corporation. 

There can be no assurances that any existing health care laws and regulations will remain in their current 
form. Further, there can be no assurances that any potential changes to the laws and regulations governing health care 
would not have a material adverse financial or operational impact on the Corporation. 

Similarly, President Trump and the Congressional majority leaders and members of their caucuses have 
expressed support for “tax reform” measures that would make significant changes to the Code, including potential 
reduction of corporate and personal marginal federal income tax rates and a repeal of the individual mandate to obtain 
insurance coverage. 

Therefore, the following discussion should be read with the understanding that significant changes 
could occur in 2017 and beyond in many of the statutory and regulatory matters discussed. 



 23 

Federal Health Care Reform.  As a result of the ACA, substantial changes have occurred and are anticipated 
to occur in the United States health care system.  The ACA is impacting the delivery of health care services, the 
financing of health care costs, reimbursement of health care providers and the legal obligations of health insurers, 
providers, employers and consumers.  Because of the complexity of the ACA generally, additional legislation may be 
considered and enacted over time.  The ACA has also required, and will continue to require, the promulgation of 
substantial regulations with significant effects on the health care industry.  Thus, the health care industry is the subject 
of significant new statutory and regulatory requirements and consequently to structural and operational changes and 
challenges for a substantial period of time.  The full ramifications of the ACA may also become apparent only over 
time and through later regulatory and judicial interpretations.  Portions of the ACA have already been limited and 
nullified as a result of legislative amendments and judicial interpretations and future actions may further change its 
impact.  The uncertainties regarding the implementation of the ACA create unpredictability for the strategic and 
business planning efforts of health care providers, which in itself constitutes a risk. 

The changes in the health care industry brought about by the ACA may have both positive and negative 
effects, directly and indirectly, on the nation’s hospitals and other health care providers, including the Corporation.  
For example, the increase in the numbers of individuals with health care insurance occurring as a consequence of 
Medicaid expansion, creation of health insurance exchanges, subsidies for insurance purchase and the penalty on 
certain individuals who do not purchase insurance could result in lower levels of bad debt and increased utilization or 
profitable shifts in utilization patterns for hospitals.  Further, the ACA establishes the criteria for the new Qualified 
Health Plans (“QHPs”) that may participate in the state run exchanges.  A QHP must meet certain minimum essential 
coverage requirements.  However, the extent to which Medicaid expansion, which is now optional on a state by state 
basis, is either not pursued or results in a shifting of significant numbers of commercially-insured individuals to 
Medicaid, or health insurance options on exchanges are limited or unaffordable, and/or the cost containment measures 
and pilot programs that the ACA requires, may offset these benefits.  A negative impact to the hospital industry overall 
will likely result from scheduled cumulative reductions in Medicare payments; such reductions are substantial.  The 
ACA’s cost-cutting provisions to the Medicare program include reduction in Medicare market basket updates to 
hospital reimbursement rates under the inpatient prospective payment system, additional reductions to or elimination 
of Medicare reimbursement for certain patient readmissions and hospital-acquired conditions, as well as anticipated 
reductions in rates paid to Medicare managed care plans that may ultimately be passed on to providers.  Industry 
experts also expect that government cost reduction actions may be followed by private insurers and other third-party 
payors. 

Health care providers could be further subjected to decreased reimbursement as a result of implementation 
of recommendations of the Independent Payment Advisory Board (“IPAB”).  In the event that the projected Medicare 
per capita growth rate exceeds a target growth rate in any year, IPAB is directed to make recommendations for cost 
reduction, and those recommended reductions will be automatically implemented unless Congress adopts alternative 
legislation that meets equivalent savings targets.  While hospitals are largely exempted from recommendations from 
the IPAB, industry experts also expect that government cost reduction actions may be followed by private insurers 
and payors.  To date, IPAB members have not been appointed by the President. 

Beginning in 2014, the ACA created state “health insurance exchanges” in which health insurance can be 
purchased by certain groups and segments of the population, expanded the availability of subsidies and tax credits for 
premium payments by some consumers and employers, and required that certain terms and conditions be included by 
commercial insurers in contracts with providers.  In addition, the ACA imposed many new obligations on states related 
to health insurance.  It is unclear how the increased federal oversight of state health care may affect future state 
oversight or affect the Corporation.  The health insurance exchanges may have a positive impact for hospitals by 
increasing the availability of health insurance to individuals who were previously uninsured.  Conversely, employers 
or individuals may shift their purchase of health insurance to new plans offered through the exchanges, which may or 
may not reimburse providers at rates equivalent to rates the providers currently receive.  The exchanges could alter 
the health insurance markets in ways that cannot be predicted, and exchanges might, directly or indirectly, take on a 
rate-setting function that could negatively impact providers.  Because the exchanges are still relatively new, the effects 
of these changes upon the financial condition of any third party payor that offers health insurance, rates paid by third-
party payors to providers and, thus, the revenues of the Corporation, and upon the operations, results of operations 
and financial condition of the Corporation, taken as a whole, cannot be predicted. 



 24 

The ACA will likely affect some health care organizations differently from others, depending, in part, on 
how each organization adapts to the legislation’s emphasis on directing more federal health care dollars to integrated 
provider organizations and providers with demonstrable achievements in quality care.  The ACA has created a value-
based purchasing system for hospitals under which a percentage of payments will be contingent on satisfaction of 
specified performance measures related to common and high-cost medical conditions, such as cardiac, surgical and 
pneumonia care.  The ACA also funds various demonstration programs and pilot projects and other voluntary 
programs to evaluate and encourage new provider delivery models and payment structures, including “accountable 
care organizations” and bundled provider payments.  The outcomes of these projects and programs, including the 
likelihood of being made permanent or expanded or their effect on health care organizations’ revenues or financial 
performance cannot be predicted. 

The ACA has expanded access to Medicaid and the scope of services covered thereunder.  With respect to 
access, Medicaid may be available to all individuals with incomes of less than 138% of the federal poverty level, 
depending on whether a state opts to expand such coverage.  The ACA allows states, beginning in 2014, to expand 
Medicaid eligibility to non-elderly, non-pregnant individuals who are not otherwise eligible for Medicare, if they have 
incomes of less than 138% of the federal poverty level.  To assist states with the cost of covering such newly eligible 
individuals, the federal government has paid 100% of the new cost for a limited number of years.  Thereafter, the cost 
share is expected to decrease to 90%.  However, the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in National Federation of 
Independent Business v. Sebelius (2012) made expansion of Medicaid an option for each state.  In the event a state 
chooses not to participate in the expanded Medicaid program, the net effect of the reforms in the ACA could be 
significantly reduced.  Additionally, Medicaid reimbursement rates differ by state and the effect of expanded Medicaid 
enrollment must be determined on a state-by-state basis. 

The ACA contains amendments to existing criminal, civil and administrative anti-fraud statutes and increases 
in funding for enforcement and efforts to recoup prior federal health care payments to providers.  Under the ACA, a 
broad range of providers, suppliers and physicians are required to adopt a compliance and ethics program.  While the 
government has already increased its enforcement efforts, failure to implement certain core compliance program 
features provides new opportunities for regulatory and enforcement scrutiny, as well as potential liability if an 
organization fails to prevent or identify improper federal health care program claims and payments.  See also “—
Regulatory Environment” below. 

With respect to charity care, the ACA contains many features from previous tax exempt reform proposals, 
including a set of sweeping changes applicable to charitable hospitals exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the Code.  
The ACA: (i) imposes new eligibility requirements for 501(c)(3) hospitals, coupled with an excise tax for failures to 
meet certain of those requirements; (ii) requires mandatory IRS review of the hospitals’ entitlement to exemption; 
(iii) sets forth new reporting requirements, including information related to community health needs assessments and 
audited financial statements; (iv) requires hospitals to adopt and publicize a financial assistance policy, limit charges 
to patients who qualify for financial assistance to the amounts generally billed to insured patients and prohibits the 
use of gross charges, and control the billing and collection processes; and (v) imposes further reporting requirements 
on the Secretary of the Treasury regarding charity care levels.  Failure to satisfy these conditions may result in the 
imposition of fines and the loss of tax exempt status. 

Efforts to repeal or substantially modify provisions of the ACA are from time to time pending in Congress.  
In June 2012, the Supreme Court upheld most provisions of the ACA, while limiting the power of the federal 
government to penalize states for refusing to expand Medicaid, and in June 2015, the Supreme Court issued a decision 
in King v. Burwell, ruling that health insurance subsidies under the ACA would be available in all states, including 
those with a federally-facilitated health insurance exchange.  In November 2015, the BBA repealed a provision of the 
ACA which would require employers that offer one or more health benefits plans and have more than 200 full-time 
employees to automatically enroll new full-time employees in a health plan. 

On January 30, 2017, President Trump issued an executive order requiring federal agencies to remove two 
previously implemented regulations for every new regulation added. President Trump also issued an executive order 
directing each federal agency to set up a “regulatory reform task force” to review existing regulations and eliminate 
those which are costly or unnecessary. Based on these executive orders and the present political climate, there can be 
no assurances that-any existing health care laws and regulations will remain in their current form. Further, there can 



 25 

be no assurances that any potential changes to the laws and regulations governing health care would not have a material 
adverse financial or operational impact on the Corporation. 

In May 2017 the U.S. House of Representatives voted to adopt the American Health Care Act (the “AHCA”), 
which would replace portions of the ACA, including eliminating the individual and large employer mandate to obtain 
or provide health insurance coverage, respectively, imposing a per capita cap on federal funding of Medicaid 
programs, or permitting the transition of federal funding to block grants, and permitting states to seek waivers of 
certain federal essential health benefit and pre-existing condition requirements.  In June 2017, the U.S. Senate 
proposed a corresponding bill containing substantially similar provisions as described above with respect to the AHCA 
but with other slight variations from the bill approved by the House of Representatives. 

In addition to legislative changes, ACA implementation and the ACA insurance exchange markets can be 
significantly impacted by executive branch actions.  On January 20, 2017, President Trump issued an executive order 
requiring all federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to “exercise all authority and 
discretion available to them to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay” parts of the ACA that place “a fiscal 
burden … or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden” on states, individuals or health care providers. 

On October 12, 2017 the President signed an executive order directing the Department of Labor to consider 
proposing regulations or revising guidance enabling the formation of association health plans so that they would be 
exempt from certain ACA requirements such as the essential health benefits mandate.  The executive order also: 
(i) provides for the Secretaries of the Treasury, Labor and DHHS to consider proposing regulations or revising 
guidance to expand access to short-term health plans that are limited under the ACA; (ii)  provides for the Secretaries 
of the Treasury, Labor and DHHS to consider proposing regulations or revising guidance to expand how workers use 
employer-funded accounts to purchase their own policies; and (iii) sets a priority of limiting consolidation throughout 
the health care system. 

Additionally, on October 12, 2017, the Trump Administration announced that cost-sharing reduction 
payments will no longer be made to insurers, which are still required to offer cost-sharing to certain low-income plan 
members under the ACA.  Cost sharing reduction payments help offset deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses 
for exchange health insurance coverage for approximately seven million individuals earning up to 250 percent of the 
federal poverty level.  The Congressional Budget Office previously reported that if cost-sharing reduction payments 
were to end, premiums for silver-level plans would increase by 20 percent, before premium tax credits are accounted 
for, in 2018.  On October 13, 2017, eighteen states and the District of Columbia filed suit in the U.S. District Court 
for the Northern District of California challenging the Trump Administration’s action and asking the court to issue a 
preliminary injunction mandating the continuance of cost-sharing reduction payments, which request was denied.  On 
October 17, 2017 the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and 
Pensions announced a bipartisan proposal intended to continue cost-sharing reduction payments, but no such 
legislation has been passed to date. 

 The proposed tax reform bill adopted by the Senate on December 2, 2017 would repeal the individual 
mandate to obtain health insurance imposed under the ACA. The Congressional Budget Office has indicated that the 
proposed repeal would result in a reduction by 13 million of individuals with health insurance by 2025. While 
Congress has not yet adopted legislation reconciling approved House and Senate versions, proposed reconciliatory 
legislation would remove the individual mandate to obtain health insurance effective in 2019. Any legislation 
substantially reducing the number of individuals having health care coverage could negatively impact the Corporation. 
 

These recent actions have the potential to significantly impact the insurance exchange market by reducing 
the number of plans available on exchanges and/or increasing insurance premiums.  The Corporation cannot predict 
the effect of any such executive actions on its business or financial condition, though such effects could be material. 

There can be no assurances that any current health care laws and regulations, in addition to the ACA, will 
remain in their current form.  There can be no assurances that any potential changes to the laws and regulations 
governing health care would not have a material adverse financial or operational impact on the Corporation.  
Therefore, the preceding discussion should be read with the understanding that significant changes could occur in 
2017 and beyond in many of the statutory and regulatory matters discussed. 



 26 

California Health Care Reform.  The State has enacted several laws intended to implement the ACA within 
the required federal timeframes.  Among the steps taken to date to implement or advance the ACA, the State 
established a state health insurance exchange which operates under a brand name, “Covered California”; the State 
approved expansion of Medi-Cal coverage, effective January 1, 2014, to include adults with incomes up to 138% of 
the federal poverty level who are under age 65, not pregnant and not otherwise currently eligible for Medi-Cal; and 
legislation was enacted prohibiting insurers from denying health coverage based on preexisting conditions.  In 
addition, the State is also running a dual-eligibles pilot program with federal funding.  The implementation of health 
care reform has extended coverage under Medi-Cal to approximately four million more Californians in three years 
and added new services such as treatment for substance abuse and mental health. 

Patient Service Revenues 

Net patient service revenues realized by the Corporation are derived from a variety of sources.  A substantial 
portion of the net patient service revenues of the Corporation is derived from third-party payors which pay for the 
services provided to covered patients.  These third-party payors include the federal Medicare program, the Medi-Cal 
program and private health plans and insurers, including health maintenance organizations and preferred provider 
organizations.  Many of those programs make payments to the Corporation in amounts that may not reflect the 
Corporation’s direct and indirect costs of providing services to patients. 

The financial performance of the Corporation has been and could be in the future adversely affected by the 
financial position, the insolvency of, the bankruptcy of or other delays in receipt of payments from third-party payors 
that provide coverage for services to its patients. 

Health care providers have been and continue to be affected significantly by changes made in the last several 
years in federal and state health care laws and regulations, particularly those pertaining to Medicare and Medicaid.  
The purpose of much of this statutory and regulatory activity has been to reduce the rate of increase in health care 
costs, particularly costs paid under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 

The Medicare Program.  Medicare is the federal health insurance system under which hospitals and other 
providers are paid for services provided to eligible elderly and disabled persons.  Medicare provides certain health 
care benefits to beneficiaries who are 65 years of age or older, blind, disabled or qualify for the End Stage Renal 
Disease Program.  Medicare Part A covers inpatient hospital services, skilled nursing care, hospice and some home 
health care, and Medicare Part B covers physician services, outpatient hospital services, diagnostic tests, outpatient 
therapy and some supplies.  Medicare is administered by CMS, which delegates to the states the process for certifying 
hospitals to which CMS will make payment.  In order to achieve and maintain Medicare certification, hospitals must 
meet CMS’s “conditions of participation” on an ongoing basis, as determined by each state in which they operate and 
The Joint Commission or other officially sanctioned accrediting organization.  The requirements for Medicare 
certification are subject to change, and, therefore, it may be necessary for hospitals to effect changes from time to time 
in their facilities, equipment, operations, personnel, billing, policies and services. 

As the U.S. population ages, more people will become eligible for the Medicare program.  Current projections 
indicate that demographic changes and continuation of current cost trends will exert significant and negative forces 
on the overall federal budget.  The Medicare program reimburses hospitals based on a fixed schedule of rates based 
on categories of treatments or conditions.  These rates change over time and there is no assurance that these rates will 
cover the actual costs of providing services to Medicare patients.  Further, it is anticipated there will be reductions in 
rates paid to Medicare managed care plans that may ultimately be passed on to providers. 

The ACA institutes multiple mechanisms for reducing costs to the Medicare program and thus reimbursement 
to hospitals, while also promoting new and innovative health care delivery models, including the following: 

Value-Based Purchasing Program.  Since federal fiscal year 2013, Medicare inpatient payments 
to hospitals are determined, in part, based on a program under which value-based incentive payments are 
made in a fiscal year to hospitals that meet certain performance standards during that fiscal year.  The program 
is funded through the reduction of hospital inpatient care payment by 2% for federal fiscal year 2017 and 
subsequent federal fiscal years.  This reduction may be offset by incentive payments for hospitals that meet 
or exceed quality standards.  In each federal fiscal year, the total amount collected from these reductions will 



 27 

be pooled and used to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet certain quality performance standards 
established by DHHS. 

Market Basket Reductions.  Commencing upon enactment of the ACA and through September 30, 
2019, the annual Medicare market basket updates for hospitals have been, and will be, reduced.  The market 
basket adjustments for inpatient hospital care have averaged approximately 2% to 4% annually in recent 
years.  The ACA calls for reductions in the annual market basket updates ranging from 0.10% to 0.75% each 
year through federal fiscal year 2019.  The market basket reduction for federal fiscal year 2018 is -0.75%.  In 
addition, the market basket updates are subject to productivity adjustment.  The productivity adjustment for 
fiscal year 2018 is -0.6%.  The reductions in market basket updates and the productivity adjustments will 
have a disproportionately negative effect upon those providers that are relatively more dependent upon 
Medicare.  The combination of reductions to the market basket updates and the imposition of the productivity 
adjustments may, in some cases and in some years, result in reductions in Medicare payments per discharge 
on a year-to-year basis. 

Hospital Acquired Conditions Penalty.  Effective October 1, 2014, CMS began reducing Medicare 
payments by 1% for all Diagnosis-Related Groups (“DRGs”) to hospitals that are in the top quartile nationally 
for their rate of hospital-acquired conditions.  Effective July 1, 2011, federal payments to states for Medicaid 
services related to preventable health conditions were prohibited. 

Readmission Rate Penalty.  Beginning in federal fiscal year 2013, Medicare inpatient payments to 
those hospitals with excess readmissions compared to the national average for three patient conditions (acute 
myocardial infarction, pneumonia and heart failure) are reduced based on a risk-adjusted measure of the 
hospital’s readmissions performance.  The maximum penalty of 3% has applied since fiscal year 2015.  In 
fiscal year 2015, CMS expanded the patient conditions assessed for this penalty to include acute exacerbation 
of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, elective total hip arthroplasty, and total knee arthroplasty.  
Effective fiscal year 2017, CMS expanded the program to include patients admitted for coronary artery 
bypass graft surgery. 

Medicare and Medicaid Disproportionate Share Payments.  The ACA provided that, beginning in 
federal fiscal year 2014, hospitals receiving supplemental Disproportionate Share (“DSH”) payments from 
Medicare (i.e., those hospitals that care for a disproportionate share of low-income Medicare beneficiaries 
and Medicaid enrollees) will see their DSH payments reduced significantly.  This reduction potentially will 
be offset by new, additional payments based on the volume of uninsured and uncompensated care provided 
by each such hospital, and is anticipated to be offset by a higher proportion of covered patients as other 
provisions of the ACA go into effect.  The extent to which these reductions are offset depends considerably 
on whether the state in which the hospital is located expanded Medicaid eligibility.  Medicare DSH payments 
will continue to decrease as the number of uninsured also decreases. 

On September 13, 2013, CMS issued a final rule confirming its methodology, which accounted for 
statewide reductions in uninsured and uncompensated care, and reduced Medicaid DSH allotments to each 
state.  Under this final rule, the federal share of Medicaid DSH payments was reduced by $500 million in 
fiscal year 2014 and $600 million in fiscal year 2015.  Such reductions have been delayed several times, most 
recently under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”), but are scheduled 
to take effect October 1, 2018, which extended cuts through fiscal year 2025. 

Medicare Advantage.  Hospitals also receive payments from health plans under the Medicare 
Advantage program.  The ACA includes significant changes to federal payments to Medicare Advantage 
plans resulting in a transition to benchmark payments tied to the level of fee-for-service spending in the 
applicable county.  Decreased federal payments to the Medicare Advantage plans whether through 
adjustments to benchmark payments or other federal policy changes could in turn affect the scope of coverage 
of these plans or cause plan sponsors to negotiate lower payments to providers. 

Quality Improvement Covenants.  Health care insurers are required to include quality improvement 
covenants in their contracts with hospital providers, and are required to report their progress on such actions 
to the Secretary of the DHHS.  Commencing January 1, 2015, health care insurers participating in the health 



 28 

insurance exchanges are allowed to contract only with hospitals with more than 50 beds that have 
implemented programs designed to ensure patient safety and enhance quality of care.  The effect of these 
provisions upon the process of negotiating contracts with insurers or the costs of implementing such programs 
cannot be predicted. 

Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation.  The ACA creates a Center for Medicare and 
Medicaid Innovation (“CMMI”) to test innovative payment and service delivery models and to implement 
various demonstration programs and pilot projects to test, evaluate, encourage and expand new payment 
structures and methodologies to reduce health care expenditures while maintaining or improving quality of 
care.  Demonstration efforts include, bundled payments under Medicare and Medicaid.  Other provisions 
encourage the creation of new health care delivery models, such as accountable care organizations (described 
below) or combinations of provider organizations, that voluntarily meet quality thresholds to share in the cost 
savings they achieve for the Medicare program.  CMMI has begun testing new payment and service delivery 
models by instituting mandatory pilot programs.  For example, the Comprehensive Care for Joint 
Replacement (“CJR”) Model is currently in effect.  Other proposed mandatory models include extending the 
CJR model to include hip fracture and cardiac episode payment models for acute myocardial infarction 
hospitalization and coronary artery bypass graft surgery, although these proposals have been delayed and it 
is not possible to predict whether they will be further delayed, amended or retracted.  The outcomes of these 
projects and programs, including their effect on payments to providers and financial performance, cannot be 
predicted. 

For information concerning the Medicare payments received by the Corporation for the fiscal years ended 
August 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, see APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION CONCERNING STANFORD HEALTH 
CARE—SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION—Sources of Revenue.” 

Hospital Inpatient Reimbursement.  Hospitals generally are paid for inpatient services rendered to Medicare 
beneficiaries under the inpatient prospective payment system (the “IPPS”).  Under the IPPS, for each covered 
hospitalization, Medicare pays a predetermined base operating payment and a separate predetermined base payment 
for capital-related costs.  Each hospitalization of a Medicare beneficiary is classified into one of several hundred 
diagnosis-related groups, or DRGs.  The IPPS payment rate is not linked directly to the hospital’s actual cost of treating 
a particular patient.  It is a fixed sum, generally based on national DRG rates and a Hospital Wage Index intended to 
reflect geographic differences in the cost of labor.  Several hospital characteristics are reflected in payment 
adjustments, including an indirect medical education adjustment, the disproportionate share adjustment to pay certain 
hospitals for a portion of the higher costs of treating a large proportion of poor patients and for indirect costs of 
operating in areas accessible to poor patients and outlier case adjustments (an additional payment for selected cases 
of unusually long stays or high costs).  Therefore, the actual cost of care, including capital costs, may be more or less 
than the DRG rate.  In addition, DRG rates are subject to adjustment by CMS, including reductions mandated by the 
ACA, and are further subject to federal budget considerations.  There is no guarantee that DRG rates, as they change 
from time to time, will cover actual costs of providing services to Medicare patients.  For information regarding the 
impact of the ACA on payments to hospitals for inpatient services, see “—The Medicare Program” above. 

Effective October 1, 2013, CMS adopted a policy known as the Inpatient Hospital Prepayment Review 
“Probe & Educate” review process or the “Two-Midnight” rule.  The “Two-Midnight” rule specifies that hospital 
stays spanning two or more midnights after the beneficiary is properly and formally admitted as an inpatient will be 
presumed to be “reasonable and necessary” for purposes of inpatient reimbursement.  With some exceptions, 
beneficiaries whose stays are not expected to extend past two midnights should not be admitted and should instead be 
billed as outpatient.  Enforcement of the “Two-Midnight” rule was ultimately delayed until 2015.  Effective October 1, 
2015, responsibility for initial review of inpatient admissions shifted from Medicare administrative contractors to 
quality improvement organizations (“QIO”), and recovery audit contractors will conduct reviews for providers 
referred by the related QIO.  Effective January 1, 2016, the “Two-Midnight” rule was revised to allow an exception 
for Medicare Part A payment on a case-by-case basis for inpatient admissions that do not satisfy the two-midnight 
benchmark if documentation in the medical records supports that the patient required inpatient care.  CMS has 
announced that it will not continue to impose an inpatient payment cut to hospitals under the “Two-Midnight” rule 
starting in 2017, following ongoing industry criticism and a legal challenge.  In the 2017 Medicare IPPS final rule 
released on August 2, 2016, CMS removed the inpatient payment cuts under the “Two-Midnight” rule for fiscal year 



 29 

2017 and onward.  The “Two-Midnight” rule has had, and will likely continue to have, an adverse financial impact 
for hospitals. 

Hospital Outpatient Reimbursement.  Hospitals are generally paid for outpatient services provided to 
Medicare beneficiaries under the Outpatient Prospective Payment System (“Outpatient PPS”), which is based on 
established categories of treatments or conditions known as ambulatory payment classifications (“APC”).  The actual 
cost of care, including capital costs, may be more or less than the reimbursements.  Generally, the Outpatient PPS 
rates are adjusted annually based on estimated cost increases and other factors, including productivity and budget 
neutrality adjustments.  These adjustments are typically positive, and often range from 0.5% to 2.5%.  However, 
occasionally, because of statutory formulas and other legislative and administrative actions, these adjustments can be 
negative, and Medicare payments to hospitals can be reduced as a result.  Moreover, Congress often takes action to 
specify payment update reductions, which can have the effect of constraining or reducing hospital payments.  There 
is no guarantee that APC rates, as they change from time to time, will cover actual costs of providing services to 
Medicare patients. 

Medicare Physician Payment.  The sustainable growth rate (“SGR”) formula, a limit on the growth of 
Medicare payments for physician services, was enacted in 1997 and linked to changes in the U.S. Gross Domestic 
Product over a ten-year period.  From 2003 to 2015, Congress provided temporary relief from scheduled “negative” 
updates that would have reduced physician payments.  In April of 2015, Congress enacted MACRA, which eliminated 
the cut to physician payments required by the SGR formula, and substituted annual 0.5% payment increases through 
2019.  Payment rates will be frozen at 2019 levels through 2025.  While the immediate payment cuts associated with 
the SGR formula have been eliminated, it is possible that future legislative action will be taken that would once again 
trigger physician payment reductions. 

Furthermore, MACRA moved Medicare physician reimbursement from a fee-for-service to a pay-for-
performance model that will continue to control the growth of physician payments based on clinical outcomes and 
quality reporting.  In addition to the base payment methodology, physicians can earn merit-based payments based on 
factors including compliance with meaningful use of certified electronic health records technology  and demonstration 
of quality-based medicine.   

Beginning January 1, 2019, and carrying through 2025, physician payment adjustments will occur through 
the Quality Payment Program’s two reimbursement tracks – the Merit-based Incentive Payment System (“MIPS”) or 
an Advanced Alternative Payment Model (“APM”).  In calculating physician payment adjustments, MIPS streamlines 
existing quality and value programs, accounting for physician performance under the meaningful use of electronic 
health records incentive program, the value-based modifier, and physician quality reporting system.  Payments to 
physicians participating in APMs similarly accounts for performance under such programs.  Beginning January 1, 
2026, and effective January 1 of each subsequent calendar year, physician payments will be increased 0.75% for 
physicians who adequately participate in APMs, and 0.25% for those in MIPS. The outcomes of these programs, 
including the likelihood of being revised or expanded or their effect on health care organizations revenues or financial 
performance cannot be predicted, and it remains unclear what effect this legislation will have on the Corporation.  For 
example, these programs may encourage more physicians to retire, not accept Medicare (or only accept Medicare 
Advantage).  Alternatively, or in addition to other externalities of the implementation of these programs, increased 
focus and performance scoring on resource use may impact utilization of health care resources.  Furthermore, 
implementation of a quality payment system will likely require regular reporting to CMS and greater internal resources 
to monitor performance and prevent payment reductions. 

Off-Campus Provider-Based Departments.  Some health care providers bill for services as “provider-based 
entities” and, as such, are subject to CMS’s provider-based regulations.  Beginning January 1, 2017, off-campus 
hospital outpatient departments that were not billing Medicare as provider based as of November 2, 2015 generally 
will not be eligible for payment under the Outpatient PPS with the exception of certain emergency services.  To date, 
CMS has determined that such non-emergency services performed at these facilities will be paid under the physician 
fee schedule, but it is not known what payment system may be designated in the future.  The new payment 
methodology for these locations and services has resulted in lower payments to hospitals than in previous years for 
providing the same services.  A hospital outpatient department is considered to be “off-campus” if it is located more 
than 250 yards from a main provider hospital or a remote location of a hospital.  Administrative and judicial review 



 30 

are unavailable for determinations relating to applicable payment systems or determinations whether a provider 
department is considered an off-campus hospital outpatient department. 

Other Medicare Service Payments.  Medicare payment for skilled nursing services, psychiatric services, 
inpatient rehabilitation services, general outpatient services and home health services are based on regulatory formulas 
or pre-determined rates.  There is no guarantee that these rates, as they may change from time to time, will be adequate 
to cover the actual cost of providing these services to Medicare patients. 

Reimbursement of Hospital Capital Costs.  Hospital capital costs apportioned to Medicare patient use 
(including depreciation and interest) are paid by Medicare on the basis of a standard federal rate (based upon average 
national costs of capital), subject to limited adjustments specific to the hospital.  There can be no assurance that future 
capital-related payments will be sufficient to cover the actual capital-related costs of the Corporation’s facilities 
applicable to Medicare patient stays or will provide flexibility for hospitals to meet changing capital needs. 

Medical Education Payments.  The Corporation, as the operator of a teaching hospital, has historically 
received direct and indirect medical education reimbursement through the Medicare program.  Medicare currently 
pays for a portion of both direct and indirect graduate medical education (“GME”) costs.  These forms of additional 
payments are also vulnerable to reduction, modification or elimination.  For example, the fiscal year 2017 federal 
budget proposed to reduce Medicare indirect GME payments by 10%. 

Medicare Bad Debt Reimbursement.  Under Medicare, the costs attributable to the deductible and 
coinsurance amounts which remain unpaid by the Medicare beneficiary can be added to the Medicare share of 
allowable costs as cost reports are filed.  Hospitals generally receive interim pass-through payments during the cost 
report year which were determined by the Medicare Administrative Contractor (“MAC”) from the prior cost report 
filing.  Bad debts must meet the following criteria to be allowable: 

 the debt must be related to covered services and derived from deductible and coinsurance amounts; 

 the provider must be able to establish that reasonable collection efforts were made; 

 the debt was actually uncollectible when claimed as worthless; and 

 sound business judgment established that there was no likelihood of recovery at any time in the future. 

The amounts uncollectible from specific beneficiaries are to be charged off as bad debts in the accounting 
period in which the accounts are deemed to be uncollectible.  In some cases, an amount previously written off as a 
bad debt and allocated to the program may be recovered in a subsequent accounting period.  In these cases, the 
recoveries must be used to reduce the cost of beneficiary services for the period in which the collection is made.  In 
determining reasonable costs for hospitals, the amount of bad debts otherwise treated as allowable costs is reduced by 
35% of the total amount.  Amounts incurred by a hospital as reimbursement for bad debts are subject to audit and 
recoupment by the MAC.  Bad debt reimbursement has been a focus of MAC audit/recoupment efforts in the past. 

Recovery Audit Contractor Program.  CMS has implemented a Recovery Audit Contractor (“RAC”) 
program on a nationwide basis pursuant to which CMS contracts with private contractors to conduct pre- and post-
payment reviews to detect and correct improper payments in the fee-for-service Medicare program.  The ACA expands 
the RAC program’s scope to include managed Medicare plans and Medicaid claims.  CMS also contracts with 
Medicaid Integrity Contractors (“MICs”) to perform post-payment audits of Medicaid claims and identify improper 
payments.  These programs tend to result in retroactively reduced payment and higher administration costs to hospitals. 

Medicaid Program.  Medicaid is a program of medical assistance, funded jointly by the federal government 
and the states, for certain low income individuals and their dependents.  Under Medicaid, the federal government 
provides limited funding to states that have medical assistance programs that meet federal standards.  The ACA 
provides significantly enhanced federal funding for states to expand their Medicaid program to virtually all non-
elderly, non-disabled adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level.  Attempts to balance or reduce the 



 31 

federal and state budgets, including the balanced budget requirements in California, may negatively impact spending 
for Medicaid and other state health care programs spending. 

California Medi-Cal.  Medi-Cal is the California Medicaid program. Prior to July 2013, the State selectively 
contracted with general acute care hospitals to provide inpatient services to Medi-Cal patients through the Selective 
Provider Contracting Program (“SPCP”).  Legislation enacted in 2010 directed the State Department of Health Care 
Services (“DHCS”) to replace the SPCP, which provided for per-diem payments, with reimbursement according to 
DRGs.  Effective July 1, 2013, the SPCP was replaced by the DRG-based payment methodology, which was phased 
in over a three-year period.  The DRG payment method is based on All-Patient Refined Diagnosis Related Groups 
(“APR-DRGs”), which is a proprietary classification system for clinical conditions that is currently licensed and in 
use by many other state Medicaid programs.  Under the APR-DRG payment methodology, DHCS reimburses hospitals 
a fixed amount for each inpatient admission based on the APR-DRG for that admission, which DHCS will assign 
based on the diagnoses, procedures, patient age and discharge status submitted on the hospital claim form.  As DHCS 
and hospitals gain experience with the APR-DRG payment methodology, DHCS intends to make adjustments in 
certain circumstances.  It is anticipated that some California hospitals will see decreases in Medi-Cal payments while 
other hospitals will receive increases.  Management does not believe that these changes have had any material impact 
on the financial condition of the Corporation. 

At this time, a significant amount of legislation regarding Medi-Cal has been proposed.  However, 
management is unable to determine the impact that any current or future proposed legislation may have on the financial 
condition of the Corporation. 

Impact of Medicaid Payment Reductions.  The ACA makes changes to Medicaid funding and substantially 
increases the potential number of Medicaid beneficiaries.  To fund this expansion, the ACA provides that the federal 
government will fund 100% of the costs of this expansion from fiscal years 2014–2016, decreasing to 90% of the costs 
of this expansion in fiscal year 2020 and thereafter.  In June 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the federal 
government cannot withhold existing federal funds for states that refuse to expand Medicaid as required by the ACA.  
The State expanded Medi-Cal under the ACA, and it is uncertain to what extent the risk of lower reimbursement rates 
under Medi-Cal may be mitigated if the increased Medi-Cal utilization replaces previously uncompensated patients.  
Furthermore, there can be no assurance that legislation will not be adopted that would materially alter federal financing 
to the states in support of the Medicaid program, and there can be no assurance that any such legislation will not 
materially adversely affect the Corporation.  See also “Health Care Reform” above. 

For information concerning the Medi-Cal payments received by the Corporation, for the fiscal years ended 
August 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, see APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION CONCERNING STANFORD HEALTH 
CARE—SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION—Sources of Revenue.” 

California Hospital Fee Program.  In 2009, the California legislature enacted the Medi-Cal Hospital 
Provider Rate Stabilization Act and the Quality Assurance Fee Act, which imposed a “quality assurance fee” on 
California’s general acute care hospitals, except for public hospitals and certain exempt hospitals.  The Medi-Cal 
hospital provider fee is essentially a tax on hospitals to raise funds for provider payments.  The proceeds are used to 
earn federal matching funds for Medi-Cal, and to increase Medi-Cal payments to hospitals.  Under this program, some 
California hospitals receive more funding in increased Medi-Cal reimbursement than the quality assurance fees paid, 
while other California hospitals receive less money in Medi-Cal payments than the fees paid.  The California Medi-
Cal Hospital Reimbursement Initiative, or Proposition 52, which passed in November 2016, extends the hospital fee 
program indefinitely and puts projections in place to prevent diversion of funds from the program.  See 
APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION CONCERNING STANFORD HEALTH CARE—SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL 
INFORMATION—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Recent Financial Performance.” 

Medicare and Medicaid Audits.  Hospitals that participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs are 
subject from time to time to audits and other investigations relating to various aspects of their operations and billing 
practices, as well as to retroactive audit adjustments to reimbursements claimed under these programs.  Medicare and 
Medicaid regulations also provide for withholding reimbursement payments in certain circumstances.  New billing 
rules and reporting requirements for which there is no clear guidance from CMS or state Medicaid agencies could 
result in claims submissions being considered inaccurate.  The penalties for violations may include an obligation to 



 32 

refund money to the Medicare or Medicaid program, payment of criminal or civil fines and, for serious or repeated 
violations, exclusion from participation in federal health programs. 

Disproportionate Share Payments.  The federal Medicare and the State Medi-Cal programs each provide 
additional payment for hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of certain low-income patients.  The Corporation 
does not qualify as a disproportionate share hospital under the Medi-Cal program.  The ACA substantially reduces 
Medicare and Medicaid payments to disproportionate share hospitals.  There can be no assurance that payments to 
disproportionate share hospitals will not be further decreased or eliminated in the future. 

California State Budget.  The State enacted a balanced fiscal year 2017-18 budget, which took effect on 
July 1, 2017.  However, it is impossible to predict the impact of future financial challenges to the California economy, 
including threat of future recessions, changes in federal spending policy and other events that could result in budget 
deficits.  It is also impossible to predict actions that the Governor, the State legislature or voters—via ballot initiative—
may take in the future.  It is reasonable to expect, however, that cost containment measures, including aggressive 
management of the State’s health care spending, will be pursued to keep the State’s budget in balance, which may 
have an adverse effect on the financial condition of the Corporation.  Examples of past such actions are set forth 
below: 

 Aggressive health care cost-containment efforts by the Governor and the State legislature to help 
eliminate prior years’ budget deficits, including the State’s substantial cuts to health care provider 
reimbursement, including Medi-Cal payments to hospitals.  For example, California enacted legislation 
to reduce its Medicaid expenditures through eligibility restrictions, (causing a greater number of 
indigent, uninsured or underinsured patients) and reductions in Medicaid payment rates.  In 
October 2011, CMS approved the State’s request for 10% reductions in Medi-Cal payments for certain 
outpatient services and for long-term care.  In May 2013, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the 
reductions, and in January 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the Ninth Circuit Court of 
Appeals ruling. 

 The significant expansions to Medicaid programs—Medi-Cal in California—under the ACA.  This 
expansion will require additional program funding.  Federal funding is available for some of this 
expansion, but it is conditioned on states maintaining specified beneficiary eligibility criteria and 
California has sought to limit program eligibility in recent years to reduce program costs.  In May 2016, 
individuals 19 years of age and younger became eligible for full scope Medi-Cal benefits regardless of 
immigration status.  This population was previously only eligible for restricted scope Medi-Cal, which 
only covers emergency medical conditions.  This expansion will require additional program funding, 
and will be funded with State funds if federal participation is not available. 

 While federal funding is available to facilitate Medicaid program expansion, this funding is expected to 
be temporary.  The Medicaid program expansion and the expected longer-term loss of federal financial 
support to offset longer-term expansion-related costs may require the State to reduce provider 
reimbursement rates further. 

Health Plans and Managed Care.  Most private health insurance coverage is provided by various types of 
“managed care” plans, including health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”) and preferred provider organizations 
(“PPOs”) that generally use discounts and other economic incentives to reduce or limit the utilization of or payment 
for health care services.  Medicare and Medicaid also purchase health care using managed care options.  Payments to 
health care organizations from managed care plans typically are lower than those received from traditional indemnity 
or commercial insurers. 

In California, managed care plans have replaced indemnity insurance as the primary source of non-
governmental payment for health care services, and health care organizations must be capable of attracting and 
maintaining managed care business, often on a regional basis.  Regional coverage and aggressive pricing may be 
required.  However, it is also essential that contracting health care organizations be able to provide the contracted 
services without significant operating losses, which may require multiple forms of cost containment. 



 33 

Many HMOs and PPOs currently pay providers on a negotiated fee-for-service basis or, for institutional care, 
on a fixed rate per day of care, or a fixed rate per hospital stay, which, in each case, usually is discounted from the 
usual and customary charges for the care provided.  As a result, the discounts offered to HMOs and PPOs could, in 
some cases, result in payment to a provider that is less than its actual cost.  Additionally, the volume of patients 
directed to a provider may vary significantly from projections, and changes in the utilization may be dramatic and 
unexpected, thus jeopardizing the provider’s ability to manage this component of revenue and cost. 

Some HMOs employ a “capitation” payment method under which health care organizations are paid a 
predetermined periodic rate for each enrollee in the HMO who is “assigned” or otherwise directed to receive care from 
a particular health care organization.  The health care organization may assume financial risk for the cost and scope 
of institutional care given.  If payment is insufficient to meet the health care organization’s actual costs of care, or if 
utilization by such enrollees materially exceeds projections, the financial condition of the health care organization 
could erode rapidly and significantly.  In addition to this standard managed care risk sharing approach, private health 
insurance companies are increasingly adopting various additional risk sharing/cost containing measures, sometimes 
similar to those introduced by government payors.  Commercial insurers are also adopting total cost of care and pay 
for performance strategies with providers.  Providers may expect health care cost containment and its associated risk 
sharing to continue to increase in the coming years amongst all payors. 

Often, managed care contracts are enforceable for a stated term, regardless of health care organization losses, 
and may require health care organizations to care for enrollees for a certain time period, regardless of whether the 
payor is able to pay the health care organization.  Disputes with HMOs, PPOs and other managed care payors may 
result in mediation, arbitration or litigation.  Health care organizations from time to time have disputes with HMOs, 
PPOs and other managed care payors concerning payment and contract interpretation issues. 

There is no assurance that the Corporation will maintain particular insurance contracts, existing rates or 
obtain contracts from other third party payors in the future.  Failure to maintain contracts could have the effect of 
reducing a health care organization’s net patient services revenues.  Conversely, participation may result in lower net 
income if participating health care organizations are unable to adequately contain their costs.  In part to reduce costs, 
health plans are increasingly implementing, and offering to purchasing employers, tiered provider networks, which 
involve classification of a plan’s network providers into different tiers based on care quality and cost.  With tiered 
benefit designs, plan enrollees are generally encouraged, through incentives or reductions in copayments or 
deductibles, to seek care from providers in the top tier.  Classification of a hospital in a non-preferred or lower tier by 
a significant payor may result in a material loss of volume. 

In addition to tiered provider networks, managed care plans are also implementing narrow provider networks 
in which only a select group of providers participate as in-network providers.  Managed care plans often look at quality 
performance and cost in selecting providers to participate in their narrow networks.  A provider’s exclusion from a 
narrow network may result in a material loss of volume.  Managed care plans may offer lower reimbursement for 
providers in their narrow network(s) in exchange for additional volume expected from being one of a select group of 
network providers.  The reimbursement may be insufficient to cover a network provider’s cost in providing the 
services.  The new demands of dominant health plans and other shifts in the managed care industry may also reduce 
patient volume and revenue.  Thus, managed care poses one of the most significant business risks (and opportunities) 
that health care organizations face. 

In addition, the current trend of consolidation in the health insurance industry is likely to increase the leverage 
of commercial insurers when negotiating rates with health care providers.  Large health insurers that assume dominant 
positions in local markets threaten to increase health insurer concentration, reduce competition and decrease choice.  
If the Corporation were to terminate its agreement with any of the major managed care payers or not agree to terms 
proposed by such payers, it could have a significant material adverse impact on the financial condition of the 
Corporation. 

With implementation of the ACA, substantial numbers of individuals are choosing health insurance under 
the health insurance exchanges, increasing the number of individuals covered in the individual market.  Individuals 
choosing their own coverage may become highly price sensitive, which could increase the number of enrollees in 
HMO plans and increase the use of capitation, making price negotiations with HMO and other insurance plans more 
difficult.

HEALTH CARE—SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION—Sources of Revenue.” 

International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision Coding System.  In 2009, CMS published the final 
rule adopting the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision coding system (“ICD-10”), which became 
effective in October 2015.  ICD-10 provides a common approach to the classification of diseases and other health 
problems, allowing the United States to align with other nations to better share medical information, diagnosis, and 
treatment codes.  ICD-10 is not without risk as staff had to be retrained, processes redesigned, and computer 
applications modified as the current available codes and digit size dramatically increased.  Additionally, there is a 
potential for temporary coding and payment backlog, as well as potential increases in claims errors.  In 
September 2015, CMS approved a “crosswalk” approach to coding conversion for Medicaid agencies in California, 
Louisiana, Maryland and Montana.  Rather than full conversion to the new ICD-10 system, those states instead will 
be allowed to convert ICD-10 claims into ICD-9 codes for calculating payments under Medicaid fee-for-service 
programs.  While this crosswalk approach creates risk of payment delays and potential errors, most Medicaid claims, 
particularly in California, are covered under capitated Medicaid managed care plans which do not bill for specific 
services under the coding system.  At this time, however, it is not possible to predict the effects of full, or crosswalk, 
ICD-10 implementation. 

Negative Rankings Based on Clinical Outcomes, Cost, Quality, Patient Satisfaction and Other 
Performance Measures.  Health plans, Medicare, Medicaid, Medi-Cal, employers, trade groups and other purchasers 
of health services, private standard-setting organizations and accrediting agencies increasingly are using statistical and 
other measures in efforts to characterize, publicize, compare, rank and change the quality, safety and cost of health 
care services provided by hospitals and providers.  The ACA shifts payments from paying for volume to paying for 
value, based on various health outcome measures.  Published rankings such as “score cards,” “pay for performance” 
and other financial and non-financial incentive programs are being introduced to affect the reputation and revenue of 
hospitals, the members of their medical staffs and other providers and to influence the behavior of consumers and 
providers such as the Corporation.  Currently prevalent are measures of quality based on clinical outcomes of patient 
care, reduction in costs, patient satisfaction and investment in health information technology.  Measures of 
performance set by others that characterize a hospital or a provider negatively may adversely affect its reputation and 
financial condition. 

Enforcement Affecting Clinical Research.  In addition to increasing enforcement of laws governing payment 
and reimbursement, the federal government has also stepped up enforcement of laws and regulations governing the 
conduct of clinical trials at hospitals.  DHHS elevated and strengthened its Office for Human Research Protections, 
one of the agencies responsible for monitoring federally funded research.  In addition, the National Institutes of Health 
(“NIH”) significantly increased the number of facility inspections that these agencies perform.  The Food and Drug 
Administration (“FDA”) also has authority over the conduct of clinical trials performed in hospitals when these trials 
are conducted on behalf of sponsors seeking FDA approval to market the drug or device that is the subject of the 
research.  Moreover, the Office of Inspector General ( “OIG”) in its recent “Work Plans” has included several 
enforcement initiatives related to reimbursement for experimental drugs and devices (including kickback concerns) 
and has issued compliance program guidance directed at recipients of extramural research awards from the NIH and 
other agencies of the U.S. Public Health Service.  Although the Corporation is not the direct recipient of such awards 
(instead, Stanford University School of Medicine is the recipient of research awards), the Corporation receives 
payments for health care items and services under many of these grants as a subcontractor.  As such, the Corporation 
is subject to complex and ambiguous coverage principles and rules governing billing for items or services it provides 
to patients participating in clinical trials funded by governmental agencies and private sponsors. 

The enforcement powers of agencies with oversight of clinical research range from substantial fines and 
penalties to exclusion of researchers and suspension or termination of entire research programs.  Billing of the 
Medicare program for experimental care provided to patients that is not eligible for Medicare reimbursement can 
subject the Corporation to sanctions as well as repayment obligations.

Regulatory Environment 

“Fraud” and “False Claims.”  Health care “fraud and abuse” laws have been enacted at the federal and state 
levels to broadly regulate the provision of services to government program beneficiaries and the methods and 
requirements for submitting claims for services rendered to the beneficiaries.  Under these laws, hospitals and others 
can be penalized for a wide variety of conduct, including submitting claims for services that are not provided, billing 
in a manner that does not comply with government requirements or submitting inaccurate billing information, billing 
for services deemed to be medically unnecessary, or billings accompanied by an illegal inducement to utilize or refrain 
from utilizing a service or product. 

Federal and state governments have a broad range of criminal, civil and administrative sanctions available to 
penalize and remediate health care fraud, including the exclusion of a hospital from participation in the 
Medicare/Medicaid programs, civil monetary penalties, requiring execution of corrective action plans, and suspension 
of Medicare/Medicaid payments.  Fraud and abuse cases may be prosecuted by one or more government entities and/or 
private individuals, and more than one of the available sanctions may be, and often are, imposed for each violation.  
The ACA also authorizes the Secretary of DHHS to suspend payments to a provider pending an investigation or 
prosecution of a credible allegation of fraud against the provider. 

Laws governing fraud and abuse may apply to a hospital and to nearly all individuals and entities with which 
a hospital does business.  Fraud investigations, settlements, prosecutions and related publicity can have a material 
adverse effect on hospitals.  See “Enforcement Activity,” below.  Major elements of these often highly technical laws 
and regulations are generally summarized below. 

False Claims Act.  The federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) makes it illegal to knowingly submit or present a 
false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment or approval for payment for which the federal government provides, 
or reimburses at least some portion of the requested money or property.  Because the term “knowingly” is defined 
broadly under the law to include not only actual knowledge but also deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard of the 
facts, the FCA can be used to punish a wide range of conduct.  The ACA amends the FCA by expanding the number 
of activities that are subject to civil monetary penalties to include, among other things, failure to report and return 
known overpayments within statutory limits.  FCA investigations and cases have become common in the health care 
field and may cover a range of activity from submission of intentionally inflated billings, to highly technical billing 
infractions, to allegations of inadequate care.  Penalties under the FCA are severe and may include damages equal to 
three times the amount of the alleged false claims, as well as substantial civil monetary penalties.  As a result, violation 
or alleged violation of the FCA frequently results in settlements that require multi-million dollar payments and 
compliance agreements.  The FCA provides for potentially severe penalties: treble damages, attorneys’ fees and civil 
fines of $5,000 to $11,000 per claim.  In June 2016, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) issued a rule that more than 
doubles civil monetary penalties under the FCA.  These increases took effect on August 1, 2016 and apply to FCA 
violations after November 2, 2015.  The new penalties significantly increase the potential financial exposure resulting 
from an FCA violation. 

The FCA also permits individuals to initiate civil actions on behalf of the government in lawsuits called “qui 
tam” actions.  Qui tam plaintiffs, or “whistleblowers,” can share in the damages recovered by the federal government 
or recover independently if the government does not participate.  The FCA has become one of the federal government’s 
primary weapons against health care fraud and suspected fraud.  FCA violations or alleged violations could lead to 
settlements, fines, exclusion or reputation damage that could have a material adverse impact on a hospital and other 
health care providers.  Some regulators and whistleblowers have asserted that claims submitted to governmental payers 
that do not comply fully with regulations or guidelines come within the scope of the FCA.  Recently, the U.S. Supreme 
Court in Universal Health Services, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Escobar held that the theory of “implied false 
certification” can be used as a basis for FCA liability when (1) a claim does more than merely request payment and 
makes specific representations about the nature of the goods or services provided and (2) the failure to disclose 
noncompliance with material statutory, regulatory or contractual provisions makes the representations “misleading 
half-truths.”  The application of this new standard is evolving and could lead to an increase in FCA claims in the health 
care industry based on this theory of liability. 

Under the ACA, the FCA has been expanded to include overpayments that are discovered by a health care 
provider and are not promptly refunded to the applicable federal health care program, even if the claims relating to 



 36 

the overpayment were initially submitted without any knowledge that they were false.  The ACA requires that 
providers return identified overpayments within the later of 60 days of identification or the date any corresponding 
cost report is due or the overpayment becomes an “obligation” under the FCA.  There was initially great uncertainty 
in the industry as to when an overpayment is technically “identified” and the ability of a provider to determine the 
total amount of an overpayment and satisfy its repayment obligation within the required time period.  A March 14, 
2016 CMS final rule clarified that an overpayment is considered to have been identified when either reasonable 
diligence is completed (including determination of the overpayment amount) or on the day the person received credible 
information of a potential overpayment (if the person failed to conduct reasonable diligence and the person in fact 
received an overpayment).  That same final rule also established a six-year lookback period, meaning overpayments 
must be reported and returned only if a person identifies the overpayment within six years of the date the overpayment 
was received.  This expansion of the FCA exposes hospitals and other health care providers to liability under the FCA 
for a considerably broader range of claims than in the past. 

Anti-Kickback Law.  The federal “Anti-Kickback Law” is a criminal statute that prohibits anyone from 
soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, 
in return for a referral (or to induce a referral) for any item or service that is paid by any federal or state health care 
program.  The Anti-Kickback Law potentially applies to many common health care transactions between persons and 
entities with which a hospital does business, including hospital-physician joint ventures, medical director agreements, 
physician recruitment agreements, physician office leases and other transactions.  The ACA amended the Anti-
Kickback Law to provide explicitly that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-
Kickback Law constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA.  Another amendment provides that an 
Anti-Kickback Law violation may be established without showing that an individual knew of the statute’s 
proscriptions or acted with specific intent to violate the Anti-Kickback Law, but only that the conduct was generally 
wrongful. 

Violations or alleged violations of the Anti-Kickback Law may result in settlements that require multi-million 
dollar payments and onerous corporate integrity agreements.  The Anti-Kickback Law can be prosecuted either 
criminally or civilly.  A criminal violation may be prosecuted as a felony, subject to a fine of up to $25,000 for each 
act (which may be each item or each bill sent to a federal program), imprisonment and exclusion from the Medicare 
and Medicaid programs, any of which could have a significant detrimental effect on the financial stability of most 
hospitals.  In addition, civil monetary penalties of $74,792 per item or service in noncompliance (which may be each 
item or each bill sent to a federal program) or an “assessment” of three times the amount claimed may be imposed.  
Increasingly, the federal government and qui tam relators are prosecuting violations of the Anti-Kickback Law under 
the FCA, based on the argument that claims resulting from an illegal kickback arrangement are also false claims for 
FCA purposes.  See the discussion under the subheading “False Claims Act” above.  The IRS has taken the position 
that hospitals that are in violation of the Anti-Kickback Law may also be subject to revocation of their tax-exempt 
status.  See “—Tax-Exempt Status and Other Tax Matters” below. 

Stark Referral Law.  The federal “Stark” statute (“Stark” or the “Stark Law”) prohibits the referral of 
Medicare patients for certain designated health services (including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, clinical 
laboratory services, and radiation and other imaging services) to entities with which the referring physician, or 
immediate family member, has a financial relationship unless that relationship fits within a Stark exception.  It also 
prohibits a hospital furnishing the designated services from billing Medicare, or any other payor or individual for 
services performed pursuant to a prohibited referral.  The government does not need to prove that the entity knew that 
the referral was prohibited to establish a Stark violation.  If certain substantive and technical requirements of an 
applicable exception are not satisfied, many ordinary business practices and economically desirable arrangements 
between hospitals and physicians, which constitute “financial relationships” would fall within the meaning of the Stark 
statute, thus triggering the prohibition on referrals and billing.  Most providers of designated health services with 
physician relationships have some exposure to liability under the Stark statute. 

Medicare may deny payment for all services performed based on a prohibited referral and a hospital that has 
billed for prohibited services may be obligated to notify and refund the amounts collected from the Medicare program.  
For example, if an office lease between a hospital and a large group of heart surgeons is found to violate Stark, the 
hospital could be obligated to repay CMS for the payments received from Medicare for all of the heart surgeries 
performed by all of the physicians in the group for the duration of the lease; a potentially significant amount.  The 
government may also seek substantial civil monetary penalties, and in some cases, a hospital may be excluded from 



 37 

the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  Potential repayments to CMS, settlements, fines or exclusion for a Stark Law 
violation or alleged violation could have a material adverse impact on a hospital and other health care providers.  
Increasingly, the federal government is prosecuting violations of the Stark Law under the FCA, based on the argument 
that claims resulting from an illegal referral arrangement are also false claims for FCA purposes.  See the discussion 
under the subheading “False Claims Act” above.  The federal government has attempted to recover the federal portion 
of Medicaid claims referred to hospitals by physicians with whom they have a prohibited financial relationship. 

CMS has established a voluntary self-disclosure program under which hospitals and other entities may report 
Stark Law violations and seek a reduction in potential refund obligations.  The limited publicly available information 
with respect to the self-disclosure program suggests that most voluntary self-disclosure submissions remain under 
consideration by CMS for an extended period of time, and that it is difficult to predict how CMS will react to any 
specific voluntary self-disclosure.  The Corporation may make self-disclosures under this program as appropriate from 
time to time.  Any submission pursuant to the self-disclosure program does not waive or limit the ability of the OIG 
or DOJ to seek or prosecute violations of the Anti-Kickback Law or impose civil monetary penalties. 

State “Fraud” and “False Claims” Laws.  Hospital providers in California also are subject to a variety of 
State laws related to false claims (similar to the FCA or that are generally applicable false claims laws), anti-kickback 
(similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Law or that are generally applicable anti-kickback or fraud laws), and physician 
referral (similar to Stark).  These prohibitions while similar in public policy and scope to the federal laws have not in 
all instances been avidly enforced to date.  However, in the future they could pose the possibility of material adverse 
impact for the same reasons as the federal statutes.  See discussion under the subheadings “False Claims Act,” “Anti-
Kickback Law” and “Stark Referral Law” above.  California also has an FCA-type law that applies to fraudulent 
claims presented to an insurance company, which thus goes beyond the scope of the FCA and California’s directly 
analogous statute, which are limited to fraudulent claims for which the federal government is required to pay or 
reimburse a portion or all of the claim.  Under the California law, codified in Section 1871.7 of the California Insurance 
Code, a person who submits a fraudulent claim to an insurance company is subject to civil fines ranging from $5,000 
to $10,000 per fraudulent claim, plus an additional assessment of no more than three times the amount of each claim, 
and may be subject to criminal penalties under the California Penal Code as well.  Similar to the FCA, actions under 
this Insurance Code section may be initiated by private parties. 

Antitrust.  Antitrust liability may arise in a wide variety of circumstances, including medical staff privilege 
disputes, payor contracting, physician relations, joint ventures, merger, affiliation and acquisition activities, certain 
pricing or salary setting activities, as well as other areas of activity.  Consolidation transactions among health care 
providers are an area in which investigation and enforcement activity by federal and state antitrust agencies is 
particularly frequent and vigorous.  The application of the federal and state antitrust laws to health care is evolving 
(especially as the ACA is implemented), and therefore not always clear.  Currently, the most common areas of potential 
liability are joint action among providers with respect to payor contracting and medical staff credentialing disputes, 
and hospital mergers and acquisitions. 

Violation of the antitrust laws could result in criminal and/or civil enforcement proceedings by federal and 
state agencies, as well as actions by private litigants.  In certain actions, private litigants may be entitled to treble 
damages, and in others, governmental entities may be able to assess substantial monetary fines.  Investigations and 
proceedings arising from the application of federal and state antitrust laws can require the dedication of substantial 
resources by affected providers and can delay or impede proposed transactions even if ultimately it is determined that 
no violation of applicable law would occur as a result of the proposed transaction. 

HIPAA, HITECH, and Other Privacy and Security Requirements.  HIPAA, along with other federal and 
various state statutes, addresses the confidentiality of individuals’ health information.  HIPAA’s detailed privacy 
standards extend not only to patient medical records, but also to a variety of demographic, clinical and financial 
information held by “covered entities,” i.e., hospitals and other entities governed by HIPAA.  HIPAA’s privacy 
standards prohibit the use and disclosure of, and access to, “Protected Health Information” (“PHI”), a broadly defined 
term, unless expressly permitted under the provisions of the HIPAA statute and regulations or authorized by the 
patient.  The HIPAA privacy standards also give individuals the rights to know how their PHI is being used or 
disclosed, to access and amend their PHI, and obtain information about certain disclosures of their PHI.  They also 
obligate covered entities to provide Notices of Privacy Practices to individuals, which detail how the entities use and 
disclose PHI and how individuals can exercise their rights in respect of their PHI.  These requirements often impose 



 38 

communication, operational, and accounting obligations that add costs and create potentially unanticipated sources of 
liability. 

HIPAA contains security standards that require covered entities to implement certain administrative, 
physical, and technical security standards to protect the integrity, confidentiality and availability of electronic PHI.  
HIPAA also implemented transaction standards that dictate the use of standard transaction formats, code sets and 
standard identifiers in connection with certain electronic health care transactions between health plans and health care 
providers, including activities associated with the billing and collection of health care claims. 

HIPAA imposes civil monetary penalties for violations and criminal penalties for violations of its privacy 
and security standards, and these civil penalties have now been increased through provisions in the Health Information 
Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (the “HITECH Act”), which was enacted as part of the economic 
stimulus legislation.  The revised civil monetary penalty provisions of HITECH establish a tiered system of minimum 
penalties, ranging from a minimum of $110 per violation for an unknowing violation to a minimum of $55,010 for an 
uncorrected violation due to willful neglect.  Maximum penalties may reach $1,650,300 for identical violations. 

The HITECH Act also (i) granted enforcement authority of HIPAA to state attorneys general, (ii) extended 
the reach of HIPAA beyond “covered entities,” (iii) imposed a breach notification requirement on HIPAA covered 
entities, (iv) limited certain uses and disclosures of PHI, and (v) restricted covered entities’ permissible marketing 
communications. 

The breach notification obligation, in particular, may expose covered entities such as hospitals to heightened 
liability.  Under HITECH, in the event of a privacy breach, covered entities are required to notify affected individuals 
and the federal government.  If more than 500 individuals are affected by the breach, (1) the covered entity must also 
notify the media and (2) the federal government posts a description of the breach on its website and investigates the 
incident through the DHHS Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”), the administrative office that is tasked with enforcing 
HIPAA.  The OCR may also investigate breaches involving fewer than 500 affected individuals. 

Recent settlements of HIPAA breaches have reached the millions of dollars.  Any breach of HIPAA, 
regardless of intent or scope, may result in penalties or settlement amounts that are material to a covered health care 
provider or health plan.  In addition to the costs associated with any such penalties and settlements, covered entities 
may incur significant costs associated with investigating and handling potential privacy and security breaches. 

Enforcement activity is expected to increase in future years in other respects as well.  Criminal penalties may 
be enforced against persons who obtain or disclose personal health information without authorization.  DHHS is also 
beginning to perform periodic audits of health care providers and group health plans to ensure that required policies 
under the HITECH Act are in place. 

On January 25, 2013, DHHS issued comprehensive modifications to the existing HIPAA regulations to 
implement the requirements of the HITECH Act, commonly known as the “HIPAA Omnibus Rule.”  The HIPAA 
Omnibus Rule became effective on March 26, 2013, and covered entities were required to be in compliance by 
September 23, 2013, although certain requirements have a longer timeframe.  Key aspects of the HIPAA Omnibus 
Rule, some of which are discussed above in the paragraphs discussing the HITECH Act, include, but are not limited 
to: (i) a new standard for what constitutes a breach of PHI, (ii) four levels of culpability with respect to civil monetary 
penalties assessed for HIPAA violations, (iii) direct liability of business associates for certain violations of HIPAA, 
(iv) modifications to the rules governing research, (v) stricter requirements regarding non-exempt marketing practices, 
(vi) modification and re-distribution of notices of privacy practices, (vii) expanded rights of individuals to receive 
electronic copies of their PHI, and (viii) stricter requirements regarding the protection of genetic information.  While 
the effects of the HIPAA Omnibus Rule cannot be predicted at this time, the obligations imposed thereunder could 
have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Corporation. 

Under HIPAA, covered entities must include certain required provisions in their contractual relationships 
with their business associates.  Business associates are organizations that perform functions on behalf of covered 
entities, and receive PHI from the covered entities in order to carry out those functions.  Business associates are 
indirectly regulated by HIPAA through those contractual obligations.  The HITECH Act and the final rules 
promulgated thereunder provide that all of the HIPAA security administrative, physical, and technical safeguards, as 



 39 

well as security policy, procedure and documentation requirements, now apply directly to all business associates.  In 
addition, the HITECH Act makes certain privacy provisions directly applicable to business associates.  These changes 
are significant because business associates will now be directly regulated by DHHS for those requirements, and as a 
result, will be subject to penalties imposed by DHHS and/or state attorneys general.  Likewise, a covered entity may 
in certain circumstances be held liable for a breach by its business associate.  Covered entities have had to review and 
amend their business associate agreements in recent years in order to comply with these changing rules, which can be 
costly and administratively burdensome. 

In addition to HIPAA and HITECH, a number of other laws address the confidentiality of individual health 
information.  These other laws may impose more stringent privacy requirements than HIPAA does.  For instance, 
federal laws place additional confidentiality requirements on records pertaining to alcohol and substance abuse 
treatment at certain facilities.  California and other states have adopted laws that afford greater protection to certain 
types of particularly sensitive health information, such as behavioral health records.  California and many other states 
have also adopted broad data breach notification laws that extend to compromised medical and health insurance 
information.  Together, all of these laws and regulations add compliance costs and create potentially unanticipated 
sources of legal liability for the Corporation. 

Electronic Health Record Requirements.  The HITECH Act also established programs under Medicare and 
Medicaid to provide incentive payments for the “meaningful use” of certified electronic health record (“EHR”) 
technology.  In 2011, the Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive programs began providing incentive payments to 
eligible professionals and eligible hospitals for demonstrating meaningful use of certified EHR technology.  Health 
care providers demonstrate their meaningful use of EHR technology by meeting objectives specified by CMS for 
using health information technology and by reporting on specified clinical quality measures.  Beginning in 2015, 
hospitals and physicians that have not satisfied the performance and reporting criteria for demonstrating meaningful 
use will have their Medicare payments significantly reduced.  Additionally, beginning in 2014, the federal government 
began auditing hospitals’ and providers’ records related to their attestation of being “meaningful users” in order to 
obtain the incentive payments.  A hospital or provider that fails the audit will have an opportunity to appeal.  
Ultimately, hospitals or providers that fail on appeal will have to repay any incentive payments they received through 
these programs. 

Security Breaches and Unauthorized Releases of Personal Information.  State and local authorities are 
increasingly focused on the importance of protecting the confidentiality of individuals’ personal information, 
including patient health information.  Many states, including California, have enacted laws requiring businesses to 
notify individuals of security breaches that result in the unauthorized release of personal information.  In some states, 
notification requirements may be triggered even where information has not been used or disclosed, but rather has been 
inappropriately accessed. 

California medical privacy laws penalize the unlawful use or disclosure of, patients’ medical information, as 
well as unauthorized access to such information, which the laws define as the inappropriate access, review, or viewing 
of patient medical information without the direct need to do so for purposes of diagnosis, treatment or other lawful 
use.  Administrative penalties under these medical privacy laws may reach $250,000 per violation or for each reported 
event. 

State consumer protection laws may also provide the basis for legal action for privacy and security breaches 
and frequently, unlike HIPAA, authorize a private right of action.  In particular, the public nature of security incidents 
exposes health organizations to increased risk of individual or class action lawsuits from patients or other affected 
persons, in addition to government enforcement and negative media attention.  Failure to comply with restrictions on 
patient privacy or to maintain robust information security safeguards, including taking steps to ensure that contractors 
who have access to sensitive patient information maintain the confidentiality of such information, could consequently 
damage a hospital’s reputation and materially adversely affect business operations. 

In any hospital, there can be security incidents related to patient information, which stem from a variety of 
causes ranging from external or internal deliberate invasions by individuals or employees, to inadvertent loss or 
misdirection of paper or electronic records, to theft of hardware or software. 



 40 

Exclusions from Medicare or Medicaid Participation.  The government may exclude a hospital from 
Medicare/Medicaid program participation if it is convicted of a criminal offense relating to the delivery of any item 
or service reimbursed under Medicare or a state health care program, any criminal offense relating to patient neglect 
or abuse in connection with the delivery of health care, fraud against any federal, state or locally financed health care 
program or an offense relating to the illegal manufacture, distribution, prescription, or dispensing of a controlled 
substance.  The government also may exclude individuals or entities under certain other circumstances, such as an 
unrelated conviction of fraud, or other financial misconduct relating either to the delivery of health care in general or 
to participation in a federal, state or local government program.  Exclusion from the Medicare/Medicaid program 
means that a hospital would be decertified from program participation and no program payments can be made.  Any 
hospital exclusion could be a materially adverse event.  In addition, exclusion of hospital or independent contractors 
or their employees under Medicare or Medicaid may be another source of potential liability for hospitals or health 
systems based on services provided by those excluded employees. 

Administrative Enforcement.  Administrative regulations may require less proof of a violation than do 
criminal laws, and, thus, health care providers may have a higher risk of imposition of monetary penalties as a result 
of administrative enforcement actions. 

Civil Monetary Penalty Law.  The federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law (“CMPL”) provides for 
administrative sanctions against health care providers for a broad range of billing and other abuses.  A health care 
provider is liable under the CMPL if it knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, improper claims for 
reimbursement under Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs.  A hospital that participates in 
arrangements known as “gainsharing” by paying a physician to limit or reduce services to Medicare fee-for-service 
beneficiaries also could be subject to CMPL penalties.  A health care provider that provides benefits to Medicare or 
Medicaid beneficiaries that such provider knows or should know are likely to induce the beneficiaries to choose the 
provider for their care also could be subject to CMPL penalties.  The CMPL authorizes imposition of a civil money 
penalty and treble damages.  The ACA also amended the CMPL laws to establish various new grounds for exclusion 
and civil monetary penalties, as well as increased penalty thresholds for existing civil monetary penalties.  The federal 
Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015 (the “Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act”) 
required that federal agencies, including OIG, increase civil monetary penalty amounts annually to reflect adjustments 
for inflation; the Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act additionally required that federal agencies “catch up” civil 
monetary penalty amounts to reflect prior years of inflation. 

Health care providers may be found liable under the CMPL even when they did not have actual knowledge 
of the impropriety of their action.  Knowingly undertaking the action is sufficient.  Ignorance of the Medicare 
regulations is no defense.  The imposition of civil money penalties on a health care provider could have a material 
adverse impact on the provider’s financial condition. 

Compliance with Conditions of Participation.  CMS, in its role of monitoring participating providers’ 
compliance with conditions of participation in the Medicare program, may determine that a provider is not in 
compliance with its conditions of participation.  In that event, a notice of termination of participation may be issued 
or other sanctions, such as suspension or requiring execution of potentially burdensome corrective action plans, 
potentially could be imposed. 

EMTALA.  The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (“EMTALA”) is a federal civil statute 
that requires hospitals to treat or conduct a medical screening for emergency conditions and to stabilize a patient’s 
emergency medical condition before releasing, discharging or transferring the patient.  A hospital that violates 
EMTALA is subject to civil penalties of up to $103,139 per offense and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid 
programs.  Over the last few years, the federal government has increased its enforcement of EMTALA.  In addition, 
the hospital may be liable for any claim by an individual who has suffered harm as a result of a violation. 

Licensing, Surveys, Investigations and Accreditations.  Health facilities are subject to numerous legal, 
regulatory, professional and private licensing, certification and accreditation requirements.  These include, but are not 
limited to, requirements of state licensing agencies and The Joint Commission.  Renewal and continuation of certain 
of these licenses, certifications and accreditations are based on inspections or other reviews generally conducted in 
the normal course of business of health facilities.  Loss of, or limitations imposed on, hospital licenses or accreditations 
could reduce hospital utilization or revenues, or a hospital’s ability to operate all or a portion of its facilities or to bill 



 41 

various third party payors.  Certain states, including California, can levy penalties against hospitals that experience 
certain significant patient care events, including those that are classified as posing “immediate jeopardy” to patient 
health and safety.  In California, the administrative penalty for such incidents occurring on or after April 1, 2014 is up 
to a maximum of $75,000 for the first incident, up to $100,000 for the second, and up to $125,000 for the third and 
every subsequent violation within three (3) years. 

Environmental Laws and Regulations.  Health facilities are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and 
local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations.  These include but are not limited to: air 
and water quality control requirements; waste management requirements; specific regulatory requirements applicable 
to asbestos and radioactive substances; requirements for providing notice to employees and members of the public 
about hazardous materials handled by or located at the health facilities; and requirements for training employees in 
the proper handling and management of hazardous materials and wastes. 

Health facilities may be subject to requirements related to investigating and remedying hazardous substances 
located on their property, including such substances that may have migrated off the property.  Typical hospital 
operations include the handling, use, storage, transportation, disposal and discharge of hazardous, infectious, toxic, 
radioactive, flammable and other hazardous materials, wastes, pollutants and contaminants.  As such, hospital 
operations are particularly susceptible to the practical, financial and legal risks associated with the environmental laws 
and regulations.  Such risks may result in damage to individuals, property or the environment; may interrupt operations 
and increase their cost; may result in legal liability, damages, injunctions or fines; and may result in investigations, 
administrative proceedings, civil litigation, criminal prosecution, penalties or other governmental agency actions; and 
may not be covered by insurance. 

Enforcement Activity.  Enforcement activity against health care providers has increased, and enforcement 
authorities have adopted aggressive approaches.  In the current regulatory climate, it is anticipated that many hospitals 
and physician groups will be subject to an audit, investigation, or other enforcement action regarding the health care 
fraud laws mentioned above. 

Enforcement authorities are often in a position to compel settlements by providers charged with or being 
investigated for false claims violations by withholding or threatening to withhold Medicare, Medicaid and similar 
payments or to recover higher damages, assessments or penalties by instituting criminal action.  In addition, the cost 
of defending such an action, the time and management attention consumed, and the facts of a case may dictate 
settlement.  Therefore, regardless of the merits of a particular case, a hospital could experience materially adverse 
settlement costs, as well as materially adverse costs associated with implementation of any settlement agreement.  
Prolonged and publicized investigations could be damaging to the reputation and business of a hospital, regardless of 
outcome. 

Certain acts or transactions may result in violation or alleged violation of a number of the federal health care 
fraud laws described above, and therefore penalties or settlement amounts often are compounded.  Generally these 
risks are not covered by insurance.  Enforcement actions may involve multiple hospitals or other facilities in a health 
system, as the government often extends enforcement actions regarding health care fraud to other entities in the same 
organization.  Therefore, Medicare fraud related risks identified as being materially adverse to a hospital could have 
materially adverse consequences to a health system taken as a whole. 

Business Relationships and Other Business Matters 

Integrated Delivery Systems.  Hospitals and health care systems often own, control or have affiliations with 
physician groups and independent practice associations.  Generally, the sponsoring health facility or health system is 
the primary capital and funding source for such alliances and may have an ongoing financial commitment to provide 
growth capital and support operating deficits.  As separate operating units, integrated physician practices and medical 
foundations sometimes operate at a loss and require subsidies or other support from the related hospital or health 
system.  In addition, integrated delivery systems present business challenges and risks.  Inability to attract or retain 
participating physicians may negatively affect managed care, contracting and utilization.  The technological and 
administrative infrastructure necessary both to develop and operate integrated delivery systems and to implement new 
payment arrangements in response to changes in Medicare and other payor reimbursement is costly.  Hospitals may 
not achieve savings sufficient to offset the substantial costs of creating and maintaining this infrastructure. 



 42 

These types of alliances are generally designed to respond to trends in the delivery of medicine to better 
integrate hospital and physician care, to increase physician availability to the community and/or to enhance the 
managed care capability of the affiliated hospitals and physicians.  However, these goals may not be achieved, and an 
unsuccessful alliance may be costly and counterproductive to all of the above-stated goals. 

These types of alliances are likely to become increasingly important to the success of hospitals in the future 
as a result of changes to the health care delivery and reimbursement systems that are intended to restrain the rate of 
increases of health care costs, encourage coordinated care, promote collective provider accountability and improve 
clinical outcomes.  The ACA authorizes several alternative payment programs for Medicare that promote, reward or 
necessitate integration among hospitals, physicians and other providers. 

Whether these programs will achieve their objectives and be expanded or mandated as conditions of Medicare 
participation cannot be predicted.  However, Congress and CMS have clearly emphasized continuing the trend away 
from the fee-for-service reimbursement model, which began in the 1980s with the introduction of the prospective 
payment system for inpatient care, and toward an episode-based payment model that rewards use of evidence-based 
protocols, quality and satisfaction in patient outcomes, efficiency in using resources, and the ability to measure and 
report clinical performance.  This shift is likely to favor integrated delivery systems, which may be better able than 
stand-alone providers to realize efficiencies, coordinate services across the continuum of patient care, track 
performance and monitor and control patient outcomes.  Changes to the reimbursement methods and payment 
requirements of Medicare, which is the dominant purchaser of medical services, are likely to prompt equivalent 
changes in the commercial sector, because commercial payors frequently follow Medicare’s lead in adopting payment 
policies. 

While payment trends may stimulate the growth of integrated delivery systems, these systems carry with 
them the potential for legal or regulatory risks.  Many of the risks discussed in “—Regulatory Environment” above, 
may be heightened in an integrated delivery system.  The foregoing laws were not designed to accommodate 
coordinated action among hospitals, physicians and other health care providers to set standards, reduce costs and share 
savings, among other things.  The ability of hospitals or health systems to conduct integrated physician operations 
may be altered or eliminated in the future by legal or regulatory interpretation or changes, or by health care fraud 
enforcement.  In addition, participating physicians may seek their independence for a variety of reasons, thus putting 
the hospital or health system’s investment at risk, and potentially reducing its managed care leverage and/or overall 
utilization.  In October 2011, CMS, the Federal Trade Commission and DOJ jointly issued guidance regarding waivers 
and safe harbors to enable providers to participate in the Medicare Shared Savings Program (“MSSP”).  There can be 
no assurance that such waivers or other regulations or guidance will sufficiently clarify the scope of permissible 
activity in all cases.  State law prohibitions, such as the bar on the corporate practice of medicine, or state law 
requirements, such as insurance laws regarding licensure and minimum financial reserve holdings of risk-bearing 
organizations, may also introduce complexity, risk and additional costs in organizing and operating integrated delivery 
systems.  Tax-exempt hospitals and health systems also face the risk in affiliating with for-profit entities that the IRS 
will determine that compensation practices or business arrangements result in private benefit or private use or generate 
unrelated business income for the hospitals and health systems. 

Health care providers, responding to health care reform and other industry pressures, are increasingly moving 
toward integrated delivery systems, managing the health of populations of individuals, patient-centered medical 
homes, bundled payments, and capitated insurance plans.  These trends will require new infrastructures, including the 
appropriate mix of physician specialties, new administrative skills, close relationships between physicians and 
hospitals, insurance risk management, and new relationships between patients and providers.  Provider organizations 
may be unsuccessful in assembling successful integrated networks, may not achieve savings sufficient to offset the 
substantial costs of creating and maintaining the necessary infrastructures to support such developments, or otherwise 
could incur losses or damage reputations from assuming increased risk and could incur damage to reputations.  Some 
health care organizations that traditionally operated hospitals may, directly or in partnership, take on actual insurance 
risk, market various health coverage products and access patients by way of unknown channels.  Such new endeavors 
could adversely affect the financial and operating condition or reputation of an organization. 

Physician Financial Relationships.  In addition to the physician integration relationships referred to above, 
hospitals and health systems frequently have various additional business and financial relationships with physicians 
and physician groups.  These are in addition to hospital physician contracts for individual services performed by 



 43 

physicians in hospitals.  They potentially include: joint ventures to provide a variety of outpatient services; recruiting 
arrangements with individual physicians and/or physician groups; loans to physicians; medical office leases; 
equipment leases from or to physicians; and various forms of physician practice support or assistance.  These and 
other financial relationships with physicians (including hospital physician contracts for individual services) may 
involve financial and legal compliance risks for the hospitals and health systems involved.  From a compliance 
standpoint, these types of financial relationships may raise federal and state “anti-kickback” and federal “Stark” issues 
(see “—Regulatory Environment,” above), tax exemption issues (see “—Tax-Exempt Status and Other Tax Matters,” 
below), as well as other legal and regulatory risks, and these could have a material adverse impact on hospitals. 

Accountable Care Organizations.  The ACA established the MSSP, which seeks to promote accountability 
and coordination of care through the creation of ACOs.  The program allows hospitals, physicians and others to form 
ACOs and work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign integrated delivery processes to achieve high quality 
and efficient delivery of services.  ACOs that achieve quality performance standards will be eligible to share in a 
portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program.  DHHS has significant discretion to determine key elements 
of the program, including what steps providers must take to be considered an ACO, how to decide if Medicare program 
savings have occurred, and what portion of such savings will be paid to ACOs. 

To qualify as an ACO, organizations must agree to be accountable for the overall care of their Medicare 
beneficiaries, have adequate participation of primary care physicians, define processes to promote evidence-based 
medicine, report on quality and costs, and coordinate care.  The ACO and MSSP final rules were published in 
November 2011 and June 2015; however, the regulations are complex and it remains unclear whether the qualification 
requirements will be a formidable barrier for providers.  It is probable that hospital participants in ACOs will have to 
marshal a large upfront financial investment to form unique and untested ACO structures, which may or may not 
succeed in gaining qualification.  For those ACOs that do qualify, it is not clear if the savings will be adequate to 
recoup the initial investment.  In addition, although the regulation provides for waivers of certain federal laws, there 
may remain regulatory risks for participating hospitals, as well as financial and operational risks.  The applicable 
regulating bodies have published guidance for ACOs to follow in order to comply with the law, but the published 
guidance is complex. 

In particular, because the federal ACO regulation would not preempt state law, California providers 
participating as a federal ACO must be organized and operated in compliance with California’s existing statutes and 
regulations.  Numerous organizations have formed ACOs and been selected by CMS to participate in the MSSP.  CMS 
is also developing and implementing more advanced ACO payment models, such as the Next Generation ACO Model, 
which require ACOs to assume greater risk for attributed beneficiaries.  Providers participating in MSSP and other 
ACO payment models developed by CMS may not be able to recoup their investments and may suffer further losses 
if they are not able to meet quality targets and sufficiently control the cost of care for their attributed beneficiaries.  In 
addition, it is anticipated that private insurers may seek to establish similar incentives for providers, while requiring 
change in infrastructure and organization.  The potential impacts of these initiatives and the regulation for ACOs are 
unknown and continually evolving, but introduce greater risk and complexity to health care finance and operations. 

Hospital Pricing.  Inflation in hospital prices may evoke action by legislatures, payors or consumers.  It is 
possible that legislative action at the state or national level may be taken with regard to the pricing of health care 
services.  California law requires every hospital to offer reduced rates to underinsured and uninsured patients that may 
have low to moderate income. 

Hospital Medical Staff.  The primary relationship between a hospital and physicians who practice in it is 
through the hospital’s organized medical staff.  Medical staff bylaws, rules and policies establish the criteria and 
procedures by which a physician may have his or her privileges or membership curtailed, denied or revoked.  
Physicians who are denied medical staff membership or certain clinical privileges or who have such membership or 
privileges curtailed or revoked often file legal actions against hospitals and medical staffs.  Such actions may include 
a wide variety of claims, some of which could result in substantial uninsured damages to a hospital.  In addition, 
failure of the hospital governing body to adequately oversee the conduct of its medical staff may result in hospital 
liability to third parties. 

Physician Supply.  Sufficient community-based physician supply is important to hospitals and other health 
care facilities.  CMS annually reviews overall physician reimbursement formulas for Medicare and Medicaid.  



 44 

Changes to physician compensation under these programs could lead to physicians ceasing to accept Medicare and/or 
Medicaid patients.  Regional differences in reimbursement by commercial and governmental payors, along with 
variations in the costs of living, may cause physicians to avoid locating their practices in communities with low 
reimbursement or high living costs.  Hospitals and health systems may be required to invest additional resources in 
recruiting and retaining physicians, or may be compelled to affiliate with, and provide support to, physicians in order 
to continue serving the growing population base and maintain market share.  The physician-to-population ratio in 
certain parts of the State is below the national average, and the shortage of physicians could become a significant issue 
for hospitals and health care systems in the State.  Difficulties in recruiting or retaining physicians may reduce the 
volume or range of clinical services that a hospital is capable of providing and may, consequently, decrease patient 
service revenues. 

Section 340B Drug Pricing Program.  Hospitals that participate (as “covered entities”) in the prescription 
drug discount program established under Section 340B of the federal Public Health Service Act (the “340B Program”) 
are able to purchase certain outpatient prescription drugs for their patients at a reduced cost.  On August 28, 2015 the 
Health Resources and Services Administration (“HRSA”) published proposed 340B Drug Pricing Program Omnibus 
Guidance in the Federal Register, which could have had a negative effect on hospitals participating as covered entities 
in the 340B program.  This proposed guidance was withdrawn on January 30, 2017.  Whether HRSA will adopt new 
guidance in the future and what effects such guidance may have on hospitals participating in the 340B Program are 
unknown. 

In the 2018 outpatient prospective payment system final rule, CMS announced that it will reduce payments 
for separately payable drugs and biologicals (excluding drugs on pass-through payment status vaccines) purchased 
through the 340B Program from Average Sales Price (“ASP”) plus 6 percent to ASP minus 22.5 percent, which is a 
28 percentage point reduction in payments for 340B Program drugs.  CMS confirms in the preamble to the final rule 
that the 340B drug payment reduction will not apply to 340B-acquired drugs in non-excepted off-campus provider-
based departments in 2018, but that CMS may consider extending the payment reduction to these facilities in 2019.  
A number of plaintiffs, including the American Hospital Association, have filed a lawsuit challenging the cut in 340B 
Program drug payments on the grounds that CMS’s action is arbitrary and capricious and has exceeded its statutory 
authority. 

Competition Among Health Care Providers.  Increased competition from a wide variety of sources, 
including specialty hospitals, other hospitals and health care systems, HMOs, inpatient and outpatient health care 
facilities, long-term care and skilled nursing services facilities, clinics, physicians and others, may adversely affect 
the utilization and/or revenues of hospitals.  Existing and potential competitors may not be subject to various 
restrictions applicable to hospitals, and competition, in the future, may arise from new sources not currently anticipated 
or prevalent.  The strong market position of Kaiser Permanente, a closed managed care system, presents additional 
challenges. 

Freestanding ambulatory surgery centers may attract away significant commercial outpatient services 
traditionally performed at hospitals.  Commercial outpatient services, currently among the most profitable services for 
hospitals, may be lost to competitors who can provide these services in an alternative, less costly setting.  Full-service 
hospitals rely upon the revenues generated from commercial outpatient services to fund other less profitable services, 
and the decline of such business may result in the significant reduction of profitable income.  Competing ambulatory 
surgery centers, more likely for-profit businesses, may not accept indigent patients or low paying programs and would 
leave these populations to receive services in the full-service hospital setting.  Consequently, hospitals are vulnerable 
to competition from ambulatory surgery centers. 

Additionally, scientific and technological advances, new procedures, drugs and appliances, preventive 
medicine and outpatient health care delivery may reduce utilization and revenues of the hospitals in the future or 
otherwise lead to new avenues of competition.  In some cases, hospital investment in facilities and equipment for 
capital-intensive services may be lost as a result of rapid changes in diagnosis, treatment or clinical practice brought 
about by new technology or new pharmacology. 

Action by Purchasers of Hospital Services and Consumers.  Major purchasers of hospital services could 
take action to restrain hospital charges or charge increases.  As a result of increased public scrutiny, it is also possible 
that the pricing strategies of hospitals may be perceived negatively by consumers, and hospitals may be forced to 



 45 

reduce fees for their services.  Decreased utilization could result, and hospitals’ revenues may be negatively impacted.  
In addition, consumers and groups on behalf of consumers are increasing pressure for hospitals and other health care 
providers to be transparent and provide information about cost and quality of services that may affect future consumer 
choices about where to receive health care services. 

Employer Status.  Hospitals are major employers with mixed technical and nontechnical workforces.  Labor 
costs, including salary, benefits and other liabilities associated with a workforce, have significant impacts on hospital 
operations and financial condition.  Developments affecting hospitals as major employers include: (i) imposing higher 
minimum or living wages; (ii) enhancing occupational health and safety standards; (iii) imposing joint employer status 
on employers using contract, staffing agency or other temporary labor; (iv) penalizing employers of undocumented 
immigrants; and (v) complying with the employer requirements of the ACA.  Legislation or regulation on any of the 
above or related topics could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation. 

Labor Relations and Collective Bargaining.  Hospitals are large employers with a wide diversity of 
employees.  Increasingly, employees of hospitals are becoming unionized, and many hospitals have collective 
bargaining agreements with one or more labor organizations.  Employees subject to collective bargaining agreements 
may include essential nursing and technical personnel, as well as food service, maintenance and other trade personnel.  
Renegotiation of such agreements upon expiration may result in significant cost increases to hospitals.  Employee 
strikes or other adverse labor actions may have an adverse impact on operations, revenue and hospital reputation.  
Certain employees of the Corporation are currently covered by collective bargaining agreements.  See 
APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION CONCERNING STANFORD HEALTH CARE—EMPLOYEES.” 

Class Actions.  Nonprofit hospitals and health systems have long been subject to a wide variety of litigation 
risks, including liability for care outcomes, employer liability, property and premises liability, and peer review 
litigation with physicians, among others.  In recent years, consumer class action litigation has emerged as a potentially 
significant source of litigation liability for nonprofit hospitals and health systems.  These class action suits have most 
recently focused on hospital billing and collections practices, and they may be used for a variety of currently 
unanticipated causes of action.  Since the subject matter of class action suits may involve uninsured risks, and since 
such actions often involve alleged large classes of plaintiffs, they may have material adverse consequences on 
nonprofit hospitals and health systems in the future. 

Wage and Hour Class Actions and Litigation.  Federal law and many states, including notably California, 
impose standards related to worker classification, eligibility and payment for overtime, liability for providing rest 
periods and similar requirements.  Large employers with complex workforces, such as hospitals, are susceptible to 
actual and alleged violations of these standards.  In recent years there has been a proliferation of lawsuits over these 
“wage and hour” issues, often in the form of large class actions.  For large employers, such as hospitals and health 
systems, such class actions can involve multi-million dollar claims, judgments and settlements.  A major class action 
decided or settled adversely to the Corporation could have a material adverse impact on the financial conditions and 
results of operations. 

Health Care Worker Classification.  Health care providers, like all businesses, are required to withhold 
income taxes from amounts paid to employees.  If the employer fails to withhold the tax, the employer becomes liable 
for payment of the tax imposed on the employee.  On the other hand, businesses are not required to withhold federal 
taxes from amounts paid to a worker classified as an independent contractor.  The IRS has established criteria for 
determining whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor for tax purposes.  If the IRS were to 
reclassify a significant number of hospital independent contractors (e.g., physician medical directors) as employees, 
back taxes and penalties could be material. 

Staffing.  From time to time, the health care industry suffers from a scarcity of nursing personnel, respiratory 
therapists, pharmacists and other trained health care and information system technicians.  In addition, aging medical 
and nursing staffs and difficulties in recruiting individuals to these medical professions are predicted to result in 
shortages.  A significant factor underlying this trend includes a decrease in the number of persons entering such 
professions.  This is expected to intensify in the future, aggravating the general shortage and increasing the likelihood 
of hospital-specific shortages.  Competition for physicians and other health care professionals, coupled with increased 
recruiting and retention costs, will increase hospital operating costs, possibly significantly, and growth may be 
constrained.  This trend could have a material adverse impact on the financial conditions and results of operations of 



 46 

hospitals and other health care facilities.  This scarcity may further be intensified if utilization of health care services 
increases as a consequence of the ACA’s expansion of the number of insured consumers.  As reimbursement amounts 
are reduced to health care facilities and organizations that employ or contract with physicians, nurses and other health 
care professionals, pressure to control and possibly reduce wage and benefit costs may further strain the supply of 
those professionals. 

California imposes mandatory nurse staffing ratios for all hospital patient care areas, which have been 
consistent since January 1, 2008.  The impact on California hospitals will vary by facility, but the required staffing, in 
aggregate, is more costly than prior staffing patterns. 

Professional Liability Claims and General Liability Insurance.  In recent years, the number of professional 
and general liability suits and the dollar amounts of damage recoveries have increased in health care nationwide, 
resulting in substantial increases in malpractice insurance premiums, higher deductibles and generally less coverage.  
Professional liability and other actions alleging wrongful conduct and seeking punitive damages are often filed against 
health care providers.  Insurance does not provide coverage for judgments of punitive damages. 

Litigation also arises from the corporate and business activities of hospitals, from a hospital’s status as an 
employer or as a result of medical staff or provider network peer review or the denial of medical staff or provider 
network privileges.  As with professional liability, many of these risks are covered by insurance, but some are not.  
For example, some antitrust claims or business disputes are not covered by insurance or other sources and may, in 
whole or in part, be a liability of the Corporation if determined or settled adversely. 

There is no assurance that hospitals will be able to maintain coverage amounts currently in place in the future, 
that the coverage will be sufficient to cover malpractice judgments rendered against a hospital or that such coverage 
will be available at a reasonable cost in the future. 

Information Systems.  The ability to adequately price and bill health care services and to accurately report 
financial results depends on the integrity of the data stored within information systems, as well as the operability of 
such systems.  Information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and 
enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing 
technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards.  There can be no assurance that efforts to upgrade and expand 
information systems capabilities, protect and enhance these systems, and develop new systems to keep pace with 
continuing changes in information processing technology will be successful or that additional systems issues will not 
arise in the future. 

Electronic media are also increasingly being used in clinical operations, including the conversion from paper 
to electronic medical records, computerization of order entry functions and the implementation of clinical decision-
support software.  The reliance on information technology for these purposes imposes new expectations on physicians 
and other workforce members to be adept in using and managing electronic systems.  It also introduces risks related 
to patient safety, and to the privacy, accessibility and preservation of health information.  See “—Regulatory 
Environment—HIPAA, HITECH, and Other Privacy and Security Requirements” above.  Technology malfunctions 
or failure to understand and use information systems properly could result in the dissemination of or reliance on 
inaccurate information, as well as in disputes with patients, physicians and other health care professionals.  Health 
information systems may also be subject to different or higher standards or greater regulation than other information 
technology or the paper-based systems previously used by health care providers, which may increase the cost, 
complexity and risks of operations.  All of these risks may have adverse consequences on hospitals and health care 
providers. 

Future government regulation and adherence to technological advances could result in an increased need of 
the Corporation to implement new technology.  Such implementation could be costly and is subject to cost overruns 
and delays in application, which could negatively affect the financial condition of the Corporation. 

Cybersecurity Risks.  Health care providers are highly dependent upon integrated electronic medical record 
and other information technology systems to deliver high quality, coordinated and cost-effective health care.  These 
systems necessarily hold large quantities of highly sensitive PHI or other sensitive information that is highly valued 
on the black market for such information.  As a result, the electronic systems and networks of health care providers 



 47 

are considered likely targets for cyberattacks and other potential breaches of their systems.  Information technology 
systems are also vulnerable to random attacks, computer viruses, and physical or electronic break-ins.  In addition to 
regulatory fines and penalties, the health care entities subject to the breaches may be liable for the costs of remediating 
the breaches, damages to individuals (or classes) whose information has been breached, reputational damage and 
business loss, and damage to the information technology infrastructure.  The Corporation has taken, and continues to 
take measures to protect its information technology system against such cyberattacks and other events and issues that 
could result in breaches, but there can be no assurance that the Corporation will not experience a significant breach.  
If such a breach occurs, the financial consequences of such a breach could have a material adverse impact on the 
Corporation. 

Affiliations, Merger, Acquisition and Divestiture 

The Corporation evaluates and pursues potential acquisition, merger and affiliation candidates as part of the 
overall strategic planning and development process.  As part of its ongoing planning and property management 
functions, the Corporation reviews the use, compatibility and business viability of many of the operations of the 
Corporation, and from time to time the Corporation may pursue changes in the use of, or disposition of, its facilities.  
Likewise, the Corporation occasionally receives offers from, or conducts discussions with, third parties about the 
potential acquisition of operations and properties that may become subsidiaries or affiliates of the Corporation in the 
future, or about the potential sale of some of the operations or property which are currently conducted or owned by 
the Corporation.  Discussion with respect to affiliation, merger, acquisition, disposition or change of use of facilities, 
including those which may affect the Corporation, are held from time to time with other parties.  These may be 
conducted with acute care hospital facilities and may be related to potential affiliation between the Corporation and 
another party, including potential affiliation with such other party’s obligated group.  As a result, it is possible that the 
current organization and assets of the Corporation may change from time to time. See “SECURITY AND SOURCE 
OF PAYMENT FOR THE BONDS—The Master Indenture—Replacement of Obligation No. 39” herein. 

In addition to relationships with other hospitals and physicians, the Corporation may consider investments, 
ventures, affiliations, development and acquisition of other health care-related entities.  These may include home 
health care, long-term care entities or operations, infusion providers, pharmaceutical providers, and other health care 
enterprises that support the overall operations of the Corporation.  In addition, the Corporation may pursue transactions 
with health insurers, HMOs, preferred provider organizations, third-party administrators and other health insurance-
related businesses.  Because of the integration occurring throughout the health care field, management will consider 
these arrangements if there is a perceived strategic or operational benefit for the Corporation.  Any initiative may 
involve significant capital commitments and/or capital or operating risk (including, potentially, insurance risk) in a 
business in which the Corporation may have less expertise than in hospital operations.  There can be no assurance that 
these projects, if pursued, will not lead to material adverse consequences to the Corporation. 

Increasing Cost of Modern Technology.  Technological advances in recent years have forced hospitals to 
acquire sophisticated and costly equipment to remain competitive.  Moreover, the growth of e-commerce may also 
result in a shift in the way that health care is delivered, i.e., from remote locations.  For example, physicians will be 
able to provide certain services over the internet and pharmaceuticals and other health services may be purchased 
online.  If, due to financial constraints, the Corporation were less able to acquire new technology required to remain 
competitive, the Corporation could lose market share, and the financial condition of the Corporation could be 
materially adversely affected. 

Payment Card Industry Security Standards.  Health care providers have seen significant changes in the 
method, amount of transactions and dollar amount of patient payments.  Health care providers recognize that financial 
data security is a paramount concern as is continuing to protect and secure patient information.  Chip cards used at 
Europay, MasterCard and Visa (“EMV”) terminals protect against counterfeit transactions by replacing static data 
with dynamic data.  Merchants are in the process of migrating to EMV chip card technology to improve the security 
of the card-present payments infrastructure.  As a result, EMV is being introduced to health care providers. 

Beginning October 1, 2015, the liability for card-present fraud shifts to whichever party is the least EMV-
compliant in a fraudulent transaction.  This means in practice that if a health care provider has not updated its system 
to accept chip cards and fraud occurs when a chip card is inserted into the terminal, the health care provider would be 
liable for the costs.  It is not mandatory to begin using EMV compliant terminals on or after October 1, 2015 and there 



 48 

are no fines or other penalties currently in place, however, a health care provider that does not use EMV-compliant 
terminals may face much higher costs in the event of a large data breach.  At this time, it is too early to predict the 
impact that this new technology will have on the Corporation. 

Tax-Exempt Status and Other Tax Matters 

Maintenance of the Tax-Exempt Status of the Corporation and any future Members of the Obligated 
Group.  The tax-exempt status of the Bonds depends upon maintenance by each Obligated Group Member, consisting 
currently only of the Corporation, that receives or benefits from the proceeds of the Bonds of its status as an 
organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Code.  The maintenance of such status is contingent on compliance 
with general rules promulgated in the Code and related regulations regarding the organization and operation of tax-
exempt entities, including their operation for charitable and other permissible purposes and their avoidance of 
transactions that may cause their earnings or assets to inure to the benefit of private individuals.  As these general 
principles were developed primarily for public charities that do not conduct large-scale technical operations and 
business activities, they often do not adequately address the myriad of operations and transactions entered into by a 
modern health care organization.  Although traditional activities of health care providers, such as medical office 
building leases, have been the subject of interpretations by the IRS in the form of private letter rulings, many activities 
or categories of activities have not been fully addressed in any official opinion, interpretation or policy of the IRS. 

The IRS has taken the position that hospitals which are in violation of the Anti-Kickback Law may also be 
subject to revocation of their tax-exempt status.  See “—Regulatory Environment—Anti-Kickback Law” above.  As 
a result, tax-exempt hospitals, such as the Corporation, which have, and will continue to have, extensive relationships 
with physicians are subject to an increased degree of scrutiny and perhaps enforcement by the IRS. 

The ACA also contains requirements for tax-exempt hospitals through Section 501(r) of the Code.  Under 
the ACA, each tax-exempt hospital facility is required to (i) conduct a community health needs assessment at least 
every three years and adopt an implementation strategy to meet the identified community needs, (ii) adopt, implement 
and widely publicize a written financial assistance policy and adopt a written policy to provide emergency medical 
treatment without discrimination, (iii) limit charges to individuals who qualify for financial assistance under such tax-
exempt hospital’s financial assistance policy to no more than the amounts generally billed to individuals who have 
insurance covering such care and refrain from using “gross charges” when billing such individuals, and (iv) refrain 
from taking extraordinary collection actions without first making reasonable efforts to determine whether the 
individual is eligible for assistance under such tax-exempt hospital’s financial assistance policy. 

On December 29, 2014, the Secretary of the Treasury issued final regulations under Section 501(r) of the 
Code that provide detailed and comprehensive guidance relating to requirements for community health needs 
assessments, financial assistance policies, emergency medical care policies, limitations on charges and billing and 
collection practices, and also provide guidance on consequences of failure to satisfy Section 501(r) requirements.  
These final regulations are complex and may be administratively burdensome to implement.  Generally, the regulations 
apply to tax years beginning after December 29, 2015, and provide that a hospital organization may rely on a 
reasonable, good faith interpretation of the Section 501(r) requirements for tax years beginning on or before 
December 29, 2015, which may include compliance with certain prior proposed regulations under Section 501(r).  A 
failure to comply with the provisions of Section 501(r) and the final regulations issued thereunder could result in a 
loss of tax-exempt status or otherwise subject revenues of a hospital facility to federal income tax. 

In addition, the Treasury Department is required to review information about each tax-exempt hospital’s 
community benefit activities at least once every three years, as well as to submit an annual report to Congress with 
information regarding the levels of charity care, bad debt expenses, unreimbursed costs of government programs, and 
costs incurred by tax-exempt hospitals for community benefit activities.  The periodic reviews and reports to Congress 
regarding the community benefits provided by 501(c)(3) hospitals may increase the likelihood that Congress will 
require such hospitals to provide a minimum level of charity care in order to retain tax-exempt status and may increase 
IRS scrutiny of particular 501(c)(3) hospital organizations. 

The Corporation participates in a variety of joint ventures and transactions with physicians either directly or 
indirectly.  Management believes that the joint ventures and transactions to which the Corporation is a party are

consistent with the requirements of the Code as to tax-exempt status, but, as noted above, there is uncertainty as to the 
state of the law. 

The IRS has periodically conducted audit and other enforcement activity regarding tax-exempt health care 
organizations.  Certain audits are conducted by teams of revenue agents, often take years to complete and require the 
expenditure of significant staff time by both the IRS and the audited organization.  These audits examine a wide range 
of possible issues, including tax-exempt bond financings, partnerships and joint ventures, retirement plans and 
employee benefits, employment taxes, political contributions and other matters. 

If the IRS were to find that the Corporation or any future Obligated Group Member has participated in 
activities in violation of certain regulations or rulings, the tax-exempt status of such entity could be in jeopardy.  
Although the IRS has not frequently revoked the 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status of nonprofit health care corporations, it 
could do so in the future.  Loss of tax-exempt status by the Corporation potentially could result in loss of tax exemption 
of the Bonds and of other tax-exempt debt of the Corporation or any future Member of the Obligated Group, and 
defaults in covenants regarding the Bonds and other related tax-exempt debt and obligations likely would be triggered.  
Loss of tax-exempt status also could result in substantial tax liabilities on income of the Corporation or any future 
Obligated Group Member.  For these reasons, loss of tax-exempt status of the Corporation could have a material 
adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the Obligated Group. 

In some cases, the IRS has imposed substantial monetary penalties on tax-exempt hospitals in lieu of revoking 
their tax-exempt status.  In those cases, the IRS and exempt hospitals entered into settlement agreements requiring the 
hospital to make substantial payments to the IRS. 

In addition, the IRS may impose a penalty in the form of excise taxes on certain “excess benefit transactions” 
involving 501(c)(3) organizations and “disqualified persons.”  An excess benefit transaction is one in which a 
disqualified person or entity receives more than fair market value from the exempt organization or pays the exempt 
organization less than fair market value for property or services, or shares the net revenues of the tax-exempt entity.  
A disqualified person is a person (or an entity) who is in a position to exercise substantial influence over the affairs of 
the exempt organization during the five years preceding an excess benefit transaction.  The statute imposes excise 
taxes on the disqualified person and any “organization manager” who knowingly participates in an excess benefit 
transaction.  These rules do not currently penalize the exempt organization itself, so there would be no direct impact 
on an Obligated Group Member or the tax status of the Bonds if an excess benefit transaction were subject to IRS 
enforcement, pursuant to these “intermediate sanctions” rules.  However, these intermediate sanctions do not replace 
other remedies available to the IRS, including revocation of tax-exempt status. 

State and Local Tax Exemption.  Until recently, California has not been as active as the IRS in scrutinizing 
the income tax exemption of health care organizations.  With some overlap with the ACA’s mandates, California laws 
also require tax-exempt hospitals to conduct a community needs assessment, to adopt an implementation strategy, and 
to have a charity care policy.  It is possible that legislation may be proposed to strengthen the role of the California 
Franchise Tax Board and the Attorney General in supervising nonprofit health systems.  It is likely that the loss by the 
Corporation or any future Member of the Obligated Group of federal tax exemption would also trigger a challenge to 
its respective state tax exemption.  Depending on the circumstances, such event could be material and adverse. 

State, county and local taxing authorities undertake audits and reviews of the operations of tax-exempt health 
care providers with respect to their real property tax exemptions.  In some cases, particularly where authorities are 
dissatisfied with the amount of services provided to indigents, the real property tax-exempt status of the health care 
providers has been questioned.  For example, a court in New Jersey recently decided that a nonprofit hospital should 
pay property taxes on almost all of its property because it did not meet the legal test that it operated as a nonprofit, 
charitable organization during certain years.  At this time, it is uncertain whether this state-specific case will have a 
negative impact on the broader nonprofit hospital community.  Subjecting significant amounts of real property to 
taxation could adversely affect health care organizations.  The majority of the real property of the Corporation is 
currently treated as exempt from real property taxation. 

It is not possible to predict the scope or effect of future state and local legislative or regulatory actions with 
respect to taxation of nonprofit corporations.  There can be no assurance that future changes in the laws and regulations 



 50 

of state or local governments will not materially adversely affect the financial condition of the Obligated Group by 
requiring payment of income, local property or other taxes. 

Maintenance of Tax-Exempt Status of Interest on the Bonds.  The Code imposes a number of requirements 
that must be satisfied for interest on state and local obligations, such as the Bonds, to be excludable from gross income 
for federal income tax purposes.  These requirements include limitations on the use of bond proceeds and bond-
financed property, limitations on the investment earnings of bond proceeds prior to expenditure, a requirement that 
certain investment earnings on bond proceeds be paid periodically to the United States Treasury, and a requirement 
that issuers file an information report with the IRS.  The Corporation has covenanted in the Loan Agreement that it 
will comply with such requirements.  Future failure by the Corporation to comply with the requirements stated in the 
Code and related regulations, rulings and policies may result in the treatment of interest on the Bonds as taxable, 
retroactively to the date of issuance.  The Authority has covenanted in the Indenture that it will not take any action or 
refrain from taking any action that would cause interest on the Bonds to be included in gross income for federal income 
tax purposes. 

IRS officials have indicated that resources will be invested in audits of tax-exempt bonds, including the use 
of bond proceeds, in the charitable organization sector, with specific reviews of private use.  In addition, under its 
compliance check program initiated in 2007, the IRS has from time to time sent post-issuance compliance 
questionnaires to several hundred nonprofit corporations that have borrowed on a tax-exempt basis regarding their 
post-issuance compliance with various requirements for maintaining the federal tax exemption of interest on their 
bonds.  The questionnaire includes questions relating to the borrower’s (i) record retention, which the IRS has 
particularly emphasized, (ii) qualified use of bond-financed property, (iii) compliance with arbitrage yield restriction 
and rebate requirements, (iv) debt management policies, and (v) voluntary compliance and education.  After analyzing 
responses, IRS representatives indicated that it had commenced a number of examinations of hospital tax-exempt 
bond issues with wide-ranging areas of inquiry.  In the final report summarizing findings and conclusions of the 
questionnaire responses, issued July 1, 2011, the IRS stressed the importance of formal post-issuance compliance and 
record-keeping procedures.  IRS representatives indicate that more questionnaires may be sent to additional nonprofit 
organizations. 

Effective with the 2008 tax year, tax-exempt organizations must also complete Schedules H, K and J to 
Form 990, which create additional reporting responsibilities.  On Schedule H, hospitals and health systems must report 
how they provide community benefit and specify certain billing and collection practices.  Schedule K requires detailed 
information related to certain outstanding bond issues of tax-exempt borrowers, including information regarding 
operating, management and research contracts as well as private use compliance.  Tax-exempt organizations must also 
complete Schedule J, which requires reporting of compensation information for the organizations’ officers, directors, 
trustees, key employees, and other highly compensated employees. 

There can be no assurance that responses by the Corporation or any future Member of the Obligated Group 
to a questionnaire or Form 990 will not lead to an IRS review that could adversely affect the market value of the Bonds 
or of other outstanding tax-exempt indebtedness of the Obligated Group.  Additionally, the Bonds or other tax-exempt 
obligations issued for the benefit of the Obligated Group Members may be, from time to time, subject to examinations 
or audits by the IRS. 

In addition, current and future legislative proposals, if enacted into law, could cause interest on the Bonds to 
be subject to federal income taxation or state income taxation, or could otherwise affect the economic value or 
marketability of the Bonds.  See “TAX MATTERS” herein (including in particular a description of recently introduced 
federal legislation). 

The Corporation believes that the Bonds properly comply with the tax laws.  In addition, Bond Counsel will 
render an opinion with respect to the tax-exempt status of the Bonds, as described under the caption “TAX 
MATTERS.”  No ruling with respect to the Bonds has been or will be sought from the IRS, however, and opinions of 
counsel are not binding on the IRS or the courts.  There can be no assurance that an examination of the Bonds will not 
adversely affect the Bonds or the market value of the Bonds, nor that future legislative action might not limit or remove 
the tax-exempt status of interest on the Bonds.  See “TAX MATTERS” herein. 



 51 

Limitations on Contractual and Other Arrangements Imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.  As tax-
exempt organizations, the Corporation and any future Obligated Group Member are limited with respect to their use 
of practice income guarantees, reduced rent on medical office space, low interest loans, joint venture programs and 
other means of recruiting and retaining physicians.  Uncertainty in this area has been reduced somewhat by the 
issuance by the IRS of guidelines on permissible physician recruitment practices.  The IRS scrutinizes a broad variety 
of contractual relationships commonly entered into by hospitals and has issued a detailed audit guide suggesting that 
field agents scrutinize numerous activities of the hospitals in an effort to determine whether any action should be taken 
with respect to limitations on or revocation of their tax-exempt status or assessment of additional tax.  Any suspension, 
limitation, or revocation of the Corporation or any future Member’s tax-exempt status or assessment of significant tax 
liability would have a materially adverse effect on the Obligated Group and might lead to loss of tax exemption of 
interest on the Bonds and other tax-exempt debt of the Obligated Group. 

Other Risk Factors 

Earthquakes.  Many hospitals in California are in close proximity to active earthquake faults.  A significant 
earthquake in Northern California could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation and could result in material 
damage and temporary or permanent cessation of operations at the Corporation’s facilities.  The Corporation currently 
does not carry earthquake insurance coverage. 

California law requires each acute care hospital in the State to evaluate and upgrade its patient care facilities 
to meet stated seismic standards by 2008 or, in certain cases, by 2030; ultimate deadlines depend on each acute hospital 
building’s structural performance category.  OSHPD has been directed to review previously established seismic 
performance categories for hospital buildings using new software technology known as “HAZUS.”  Reevaluation 
under HAZUS may result in buildings not being required to meet any new seismic standards until 2030.  California 
law has been amended to allow various types of extensions of the 2008 deadline to 2013, 2015, 2016, 2018 or 2020, 
provided that the facility qualifies for such extension and certain requirements are met in enumerated time periods, 
including demonstrating to OSHPD reasonable progress towards meeting the ultimate deadlines. 

Construction Risks.  The Corporation has begun and will be completing substantial construction projects to 
replace and renew its patient care facilities.  Construction projects are subject to a variety of risks, including but not 
limited to strikes, shortages of materials and labor, adverse weather conditions, and delays in issuance of required 
building permits or other necessary approvals or permits, including environmental approvals.  Such events could delay 
occupancy.  Cost overruns may occur due to change orders, delays in the construction schedule, scarcity of building 
materials and labor and other factors.  Cost overruns could cause the costs to exceed available funds.  Construction 
costs have historically inflated in California between 15% and 20% annually making some projects financially 
prohibitive. 

See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION CONCERNING STANFORD HEALTH CARE—SERVICES, 
FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS—SHC’s Long-Range Master Plan and Additional Capital Needs.” 

Risks Related to Outstanding Variable Rate Obligations and Swaps.  The Corporation has variable rate 
obligations outstanding, the interest rates on which could rise.  Such interest rates vary on a periodic basis and may be 
converted to a fixed interest rate.  This protection against rising interest rates is not unrestricted, however, because the 
Corporation would be required to continue to pay interest at the variable rate until it is permitted to convert the 
obligations to a fixed rate pursuant to the terms of the applicable transaction documents. 

In addition, approximately $84.1 million of outstanding variable rate bonds issued on behalf of the 
Corporation have a “put” feature which grants the holders of such bonds the right to tender these bonds for payment 
on seven, or fewer, days’ notice.  The Corporation also has $60 million of outstanding variable rate bonds that could 
be “put” after a 30-day remarketing period plus a 6-month notification period.  Such bonds are not supported by either 
a credit facility or a liquidity facility.  If any variable rate bonds are tendered for purchase and not remarketed, the 
Corporation will be obligated to purchase such bonds. 

Risks Related to Interest Rate Swaps.  The Corporation has entered into interest rate swap agreements related 
to indebtedness of the Obligated Group (the “Swaps”).  The Swaps are and will be subject to periodic “mark-to-
market” valuations and at any time may have a negative value to the Corporation.  The Swaps counterparty may 



 52 

terminate the Swaps upon the occurrence of certain “termination events” or “events of default.”  The Corporation may 
terminate the Swaps at any time.  If either the counterparty to the Swaps or the Corporation terminates any of the 
Swaps during a negative value situation, the Corporation may be required to make a termination payment to such 
Swaps counterparty, and such payment could be material. 

Pursuant to the Swaps, the counterparty will be obligated to make payments to the Corporation, which 
payments may be more or less than the interest rates the Corporation is required to pay with respect to a comparable 
principal amount of the related indebtedness. 

Regularly scheduled payments and, in limited circumstances, settlement amounts under the Swaps are 
secured under the Master Indenture.  The Corporation or any future Member of the Obligated Group may in the future 
enter into additional Swaps and other financial product and hedge devices that also may be secured under the Master 
Indenture.  See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION CONCERNING STANFORD HEALTH CARE—SUMMARY 
OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION—Interest Rate Swap Arrangements.” 

Investments.  The Corporation has significant holdings in a broad range of investments.  Market fluctuations 
may affect the value of those investments and those fluctuations may be material.  For a discussion of the Corporation’s 
investments, see APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION CONCERNING STANFORD HEALTH CARE—SUMMARY 
OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION—Cash and Investments.” 

Contributions.  A negative change in economic conditions, including a recurrence of a recession, or declines 
in the public equities market or private investment holdings of potential philanthropy sources, may have an adverse 
impact on the Corporation’s total receipt of charitable contributions.  Failure to collect committed donations or to 
receive sufficient additional pledges of support may impair the Corporation’s ability to complete the construction 
projects or to develop programs or services that are dependent on charitable contributions.  No assurances can be given 
that the Corporation will receive charitable contributions as anticipated or consistent with historical levels. 

Epidemics, Pandemics and Disasters.  An epidemic or pandemic, or a natural or man-made disaster could 
occur and result in an abnormally high demand for health care services, damage the facilities of the Corporation, 
interrupt utility service to the facilities, or otherwise impair the Corporation’s operations and the generation of 
revenues from the Corporation’s facilities.  For example, if an outbreak of an infectious disease such as the Zika virus 
or Ebola virus were to occur nationally or in the Corporation’s service area, its business and financial results could be 
adversely affected.  The treatment of a highly contagious disease at the Corporation’s hospital facilities may result in 
a temporary shutdown or diversion of patients.  In addition, unaffected individuals may decide to defer elective 
procedures or otherwise avoid medical treatment, resulting in reduced patient volumes and operating revenues.  The 
Corporation cannot predict any costs associated with the potential treatment of an infectious disease outbreak or 
preparation for such treatment. 

Other Future Risks.  In the future, the following factors, among others, may adversely affect the operations 
of health care providers, including the Corporation, or the market value of health care revenue bonds, including the 
Bonds, to an extent that cannot be determined at this time. 

(a) Adoption of legislation or implementation of regulations that would establish a national or statewide 
single-payor health program or that would establish national, statewide or otherwise regulated rates applicable to 
hospitals and other health care providers. 

(b) Reduced demand for the services of health facilities that might result from decreases in population 
or loss of market share. 

(c) Bankruptcy of an indemnity/commercial insurer, managed care plan or other payor. 

(d) Efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit the cost of hospital services, to reduce the 
number of hospital beds and to reduce the utilization of hospital facilities by such means as preventative medicine, 
improved occupational health and safety and outpatient care, or comparable regulations or attempts by third-party 
payors to control or restrict the operations of certain health care facilities. 



 53 

(e) Regulatory actions, which might limit the ability of hospitals to undertake capital improvements at 
its facilities or to develop new institutional health services. 

(f) Cost and availability of any insurance, such as professional liability, fire, automobile and general 
comprehensive liability coverage, which health care facilities of a similar size and type generally carry. 

(g) Increased unemployment or other adverse economic conditions in the service area of the 
Corporation, which would increase the proportion of patients who are unable to pay fully for the cost of their care. 

(h) Competition from other hospitals and other competitive facilities now or hereafter located in the 
Corporation’s service area, which could adversely affect revenues. 

(i) Development of health maintenance and other alternative health delivery programs, which could 
result in decreased usage of inpatient hospital facilities. 

(j) Limitations on the availability of, and increased compensation necessary to secure and retain, 
nursing, technical and other professional personnel. 

TAX MATTERS 

In the opinion of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, Bond Counsel to the Authority (“Bond Counsel”), 
based upon an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions, and assuming, among other matters, 
the accuracy of certain representations and compliance with certain covenants, interest on the Bonds is excluded from 
gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Code and is exempt from State of California 
personal income taxes.  Bond Counsel is of the further opinion that interest on the Bonds is not a specific preference 
item for purposes of the federal individual or corporate alternative minimum taxes, although Bond Counsel observes 
that such interest is included in adjusted current earnings when calculating corporate alternative minimum taxable 
income.  As discussed further below, legislation has been introduced which, if enacted, would repeal the alternative 
minimum tax for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. A complete copy of the proposed form of opinion of 
Bond Counsel is set forth in Appendix D hereto.  

To the extent the issue price of any maturity of the Bonds is less than the amount to be paid at maturity of 
such Bonds (excluding amounts stated to be interest and payable at least annually over the term of such Bonds), the 
difference constitutes “original issue discount,” the accrual of which, to the extent properly allocable to each Beneficial 
Owner thereof, is treated as interest on such Bonds which is excluded from gross income for federal income tax 
purposes and State of California personal income taxes.  For this purpose, the issue price of a particular maturity of 
the Bonds is the first price at which a substantial amount of such maturity of such Bonds is sold to the public (excluding 
bond houses, brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or 
wholesalers).  The original issue discount with respect to any maturity of the Bonds accrues daily over the term to 
maturity of such Bonds on the basis of a constant interest rate compounded semiannually (with straight-line 
interpolations between compounding dates).  The accruing original issue discount is added to the adjusted basis of 
such Bonds to determine taxable gain or loss upon disposition (including sale, redemption, or payment on maturity) 
of such Bonds.  Beneficial Owners of the Bonds should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax 
consequences of ownership of Bonds with original issue discount, including the treatment of Beneficial Owners who 
do not purchase such Bonds in the original offering to the public at the first price at which a substantial amount of 
such Bonds is sold to the public. 

Bonds purchased, whether at original issuance or otherwise, for an amount higher than their principal amount 
payable at maturity (or, in some cases, at their earlier call date) (“Premium Bonds”) will be treated as having 
amortizable bond premium.  No deduction is allowable for the amortizable bond premium in the case of bonds, like 
the Premium Bonds, the interest on which is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes.  However, 
the amount of tax-exempt interest received, and a Beneficial Owner’s basis in a Premium Bond, will be reduced by 
the amount of amortizable bond premium properly allocable to such Beneficial Owner.  Beneficial Owners of Premium 



 54 

Bonds should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the proper treatment of amortizable bond premium in their 
particular circumstances. 

The Code imposes various restrictions, conditions and requirements relating to the exclusion from gross 
income for federal income tax purposes of interest on obligations such as the Bonds.  The Authority and the 
Corporation have made certain representations and have covenanted to comply with certain restrictions, conditions 
and requirements designed to ensure that interest on the Bonds will not be included in federal gross income.  
Inaccuracy of these representations or failure to comply with these covenants may result in interest on the Bonds being 
included in gross income for federal income tax purposes, possibly from the date of original issuance of the Bonds.  
The opinion of Bond Counsel assumes the accuracy of these representations and compliance with these covenants.  
The opinion of Bond Counsel also assumes that actions of the Corporation, the Authority and other persons taken 
subsequent to the date of issuance of the Bonds will not cause any of the Bonds to exceed the $150,000,000 limitation 
on qualified 501(c)(3) bonds that do not finance hospital facilities, as set forth in Section 145(b) of the Code.  Bond 
Counsel has not undertaken to determine (or to inform any person) whether any actions taken (or not taken) or events 
occurring (or not occurring), or any other matters coming to Bond Counsel’s attention after the date of issuance of the 
Bonds may adversely affect the value of, or the tax status of interest on, the Bonds.  Accordingly, the opinion of Bond 
Counsel is not intended to, and may not, be relied upon in connection with any such actions, events or matters. 

In addition, Bond Counsel has relied, among other things, on the opinion of Ropes & Gray LLP, counsel to 
the Corporation, regarding the current qualification of the Corporation as an organization described in 
Section 501(c)(3) of the Code.  Such opinion is subject to a number of qualifications and limitations.  Bond Counsel 
has also relied upon representations of the Corporation concerning the Corporation’s “unrelated trade or business” 
activities as defined in Section 513(a) of the Code.  Neither Bond Counsel nor counsel to the Corporation has given 
any opinion or assurance concerning Section 513(a) of the Code and neither Bond Counsel nor counsel to the 
Corporation can give or has given any opinion or assurance about the future activities of the Corporation, or about the 
effect of future changes in the Code, the applicable regulations, the interpretation thereof or the resulting changes in 
enforcement thereof by the IRS.  Failure of the Corporation to be organized and operated in accordance with the IRS’s 
requirements for the maintenance of its status as an organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Code, or to 
operate the facilities financed by the Bonds in a manner that is substantially related to the Corporation’s charitable 
purpose under Section 513(a) of the Code, may result in interest payable with respect to the Bonds being included in 
federal gross income, possibly from the date of the original issuance of the Bonds. 

Although Bond Counsel is of the opinion that interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal 
income tax purposes and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes, the ownership or disposition of, 
or the accrual or receipt of amounts treated as interest on, the Bonds may otherwise affect a Beneficial Owner’s federal, 
state or local tax liability.  The nature and extent of these other tax consequences depends upon the particular tax status 
of the Beneficial Owner or the Beneficial Owner’s other items of income or deduction.  Bond Counsel expresses no 
opinion regarding any such other tax consequences. 

Current and future legislative proposals, if enacted into law, clarification of the Code or court decisions may 
cause interest on the Bonds to be subject, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, to federal income taxation or to be 
subject to or exempted from state income taxation, or otherwise prevent Beneficial Owners from realizing the full 
current benefit of the tax status of such interest.  Legislation has been introduced in Congress which, if enacted, would 
significantly change the income tax rates for individuals and corporations and would repeal the alternative minimum 
tax for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. The introduction or enactment of any such legislative proposals 
or clarification of the Code or court decisions may also affect, perhaps significantly, the market price for, or 
marketability of, the Bonds.  Prospective purchasers of the Bonds should consult their own tax advisors regarding the 
potential impact of any pending or proposed federal or state tax legislation, regulations or litigation, as to which Bond 
Counsel is expected to express no opinion. 

The opinion of Bond Counsel is based on current legal authority, covers certain matters not directly addressed 
by such authorities, and represents Bond Counsel’s judgment as to the proper treatment of the Bonds for federal 
income tax purposes.  It is not binding on the IRS or the courts.  Furthermore, Bond Counsel cannot give and has not 
given any opinion or assurance about the future activities of the Authority or the Corporation, or about the effect of 
future changes in the Code, the applicable regulations, the interpretation thereof or the enforcement thereof by the 
IRS.  The Authority and the Corporation have covenanted, however, to comply with the requirements of the Code. 



 55 

Bond Counsel’s engagement with respect to the Bonds ends with the issuance of the Bonds, and, unless 
separately engaged, Bond Counsel is not obligated to defend the Authority, the Corporation or the Beneficial Owners 
regarding the tax-exempt status of the Bonds in the event of an audit examination by the IRS.  Under current 
procedures, parties other than the Authority, the Corporation and their appointed counsel, including the Beneficial 
Owners, would have little, if any, right to participate in, the audit examination process.  Moreover, because achieving 
judicial review in connection with an audit examination of tax-exempt bonds is difficult, obtaining an independent 
review of IRS positions with which the Authority or the Corporation legitimately disagree, may not be practicable.  
Any action of the IRS, including but not limited to selection of the Bonds for audit, or the course or result of such 
audit, or an audit of bonds presenting similar tax issues may affect the market price for, or the marketability of, the 
Bonds, and may cause the Authority, the Corporation or the Beneficial Owners to incur significant expense. 

APPROVAL OF LEGALITY 

The validity of the Bonds and certain other legal matters are subject to the approving opinion of Orrick, 
Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, Bond Counsel to the Authority.  A complete copy of the proposed form of Bond 
Counsel’s opinion is set forth as APPENDIX D hereto.  Bond Counsel undertakes no responsibility for the accuracy, 
completeness or fairness of this Official Statement.  Certain legal matters will be passed upon for the Corporation by 
its counsel, Ropes & Gray LLP, San Francisco, California, which undertakes no responsibility for the accuracy, 
completeness or fairness of this Official Statement, for the Authority by its counsel, the Attorney General of the State 
of California who undertakes no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of this Official Statement, 
and for the Underwriters by Norton Rose Fulbright US LLP, San Francisco, California, which also undertakes no 
responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of this Official Statement. 

ABSENCE OF MATERIAL LITIGATION 

The Corporation 

There is no controversy or litigation of any nature now pending against the Corporation or, to the knowledge 
of the officers of the Corporation, threatened, restraining or enjoining the issuance, sale, execution or delivery of the 
Bonds or in any way contesting or affecting the validity of the Bonds, any proceedings of the Corporation taken 
concerning the issuance or sale thereof or the execution and delivery of Obligation No. 39, or the pledge or application 
of any moneys or security provided for the payment of the Bonds. 

The Corporation, like similar institutions, is subject to a variety of suits and proceedings arising in the 
ordinary course of business.  For further discussion, see APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION CONCERNING 
STANFORD HEALTH CARE—LITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS.” 

The Authority 

To the knowledge of the officers of the Authority, there is no litigation of any nature now pending (with 
service of process having been accomplished) or threatened against the Authority restraining or enjoining the issuance, 
sale, execution or delivery of the Bonds, or in any way contesting or affecting the validity of the Bonds, any 
proceedings of the Authority taken concerning the issuance or sale thereof, the pledge or application of any moneys 
or security provided for the payment of the Bonds, or the existence or powers of the Authority relating to the issuance 
of the Bonds. 

RATINGS 

Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., S&P Global Ratings, a division of Standard & Poor’s Financial Services 
LLC, and Fitch Ratings, Inc. have assigned municipal bond ratings of  “Aa3,” “AA-” and “AA” for the Bonds. The 
ratings reflect the current assessment of each rating agency of the creditworthiness of the Corporation.  Such ratings 
reflect only the view of each organization and any explanation of the significance of such rating may only be obtained 
from the rating agency furnishing the same.  The Corporation has furnished to such rating agencies certain information 
and materials concerning the Bonds and itself.  Generally, rating agencies base their ratings on such information and 



 56 

materials and on investigations, studies and assumptions made by the rating agencies themselves.  There is no 
assurance that any of the ratings mentioned above will remain in effect for any given period of time or that the ratings 
might not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the rating agency assigning any such rating, if in its judgment 
circumstances so warrant.  Any downward change in or withdrawal of any rating might have an adverse effect on the 
market price or marketability of the Bonds. 

VERIFICATION OF MATHEMATICAL ACCURACY 

Concurrently with the issuance of the Bonds, Causey Demgen & Moore P.C. will deliver a report with respect 
to the mathematical accuracy of certain computations, contained in schedules provided to them, which were prepared 
by Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, as the Representative of the Underwriters, relative to the sufficiency of moneys 
deposited into the escrow funds established pursuant to the escrow agreements for the 2008 Series Bonds and the 2010 
Series Bonds, respectively, to pay when due, the principal, interest and redemption price requirements of the 2008 
Series Bonds and the 2010 Series Bonds, respectively.  The report of Causey Demgen & Moore P.C. will include the 
statement that the scope of its engagement is limited to verifying the mathematical accuracy of the aforesaid 
computations and that it has no obligation to update its report because of events occurring, or data or information 
coming to its attention, subsequent to the date of the report. 

INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS 

The financial statements of the Corporation as of August 31, 2017 and 2016 and for each of the two years 
then ended, included in APPENDIX B to this Official Statement, have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, 
independent accountants, as stated in their report appearing in APPENDIX B. 

UNDERWRITING 

Pursuant to a Bond Purchase Contract (the “Purchase Contract”), Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, as the 
Representative of the Underwriters, has agreed to purchase the Bonds at a purchase price of $530,337,859.30, which 
amount represents the par amount of the Bonds, plus original issue premium of $76,137,859.30.  The Corporation has 
agreed to pay the Underwriters underwriting compensation of $2,290,139.82 with respect to the Bonds. The Purchase 
Contract for the Bonds provides that the Underwriters will purchase all of the Bonds, if any are purchased, and contains 
the agreements of the Corporation to indemnify the Underwriters and the Authority against certain liabilities.  The 
Purchase Contract also provides that the Corporation will pay the fees of counsel to the Underwriters.  

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, as an Underwriter of the Bonds, has entered into a retail distribution 
arrangement with its affiliate, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC.  As part of the distribution arrangement, Morgan 
Stanley & Co. LLC may distribute municipal securities to retail investors through the financial network of Morgan 
Stanley Smith Barney LLC.  As part of this arrangement, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC may compensate Morgan 
Stanley Smith Barney LLC for its underwriting efforts with respect to the Bonds. 

The Underwriters and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various 
activities, which may include sales and trading, commercial and investment banking, advisory, investment

BACKGROUND AND ORGANIZATION 

Introduction 

Stanford Health Care (the “Corporation” or “SHC”), formerly known as Stanford Hospital 
and Clinics, is a principal teaching affiliate of the Stanford University School of Medicine (the 
“School of Medicine”) and provides primary and specialty health services to adults, including 
cardiac care, cancer treatment, solid organ transplantation services, orthopedics and neurosciences 
services.  The Corporation, together with Lucile Salter Packard Children’s Hospital at Stanford 
(“LPCH”), operates the clinical settings through which the School of Medicine educates medical 
and graduate students, trains residents and clinical fellows, supports faculty and community 
clinicians and conducts medical and biological sciences research. 

The principal clinical facilities of the Corporation are the Stanford Hospital, a 613-bed 
tertiary, quaternary and specialty hospital (the “Hospital”), and the primary, specialty and sub-
specialty clinics (the “Clinics” and, together with the Hospital, the “Hospital and Clinics”) in 
which the medical faculty of the School of Medicine provide clinical services.  The Hospital and 
the majority of the Clinics are located on the campus of Stanford University (“Stanford 
University”) adjacent to the School of Medicine in Palo Alto, California.  Other Clinics are located 
elsewhere on campus and off campus in neighboring communities and in the San Francisco Bay 
Area (the “Bay Area”).  The Corporation is currently in the process of renovating and expanding 
its existing Hospital and constructing an additional 1.1 million square feet of inpatient facilities 
(the “New Stanford Hospital”).  See “SERVICES, FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS—SHC’s 
Long-Range Master Plan and Additional Capital Needs” herein.  During the fiscal year ended 
August 31, 2017, the Corporation treated approximately 73,900 patients in its emergency 
department, admitted 25,942 inpatients and recorded 769,291 outpatient visits.  From these patient 
care activities, the Corporation reported, on a consolidated basis, total operating revenues of $4.5 
billion and income from operations of $234 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017.  At 
August 31, 2017, the Corporation’s consolidated total assets were $6.2 billion, consolidated total 
liabilities were $2.7 billion and consolidated net assets were $3.5 billion. 

The Corporation is solely responsible for the payment of principal of and interest on 
the California Health Facilities Financing Authority Refunding Revenue Bonds (Stanford 
Health Care), 2017 Series A (the “Bonds”), as described in this Official Statement.  Neither 
Stanford University, LPCH nor any of their respective affiliates other than the Corporation 
are obligated to pay debt service on the Bonds.  Stanford University, LPCH and the 
Corporation are not co-guarantors of the debt of each other, and the Corporation, Stanford 
University and LPCH receive separate credit ratings from rating agencies. 

The Corporation also expects to issue $500,000,000 total aggregate principal amount of 
taxable bonds (the “Taxable Bonds”) in January 2018 to be used for general corporate purposes of 
the Corporation, as described under “THE PLAN OF FINANCE” in the forepart of this Official 
Statement. 

Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined in this Appendix A have the meanings 
set forth in the forepart of this Official Statement.  Dollar amounts and percentages have been 
rounded in some cases to simplify the presentation of information in this Appendix A; in 
management’s view, such amounts are stated materially accurately.  More precise dollar amounts

directors as determined by Stanford University.  Currently, the Board consists of seven ex officio 
directors and twenty-three directors elected by the Board of Trustees of Stanford University.  Each 
director has one vote.  Elected directors, except for the community physician director, who serves

and ending three years after the appointment effective date, or when a director’s successor is duly 
elected and qualified.  Each elected director may serve up to three consecutive terms, with the 
exception of a director who is a clinical department chair from the School of Medicine, who may

SERVICES, FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS 

The Corporation operates the Hospital and Clinics on the campus of Stanford University, 
in neighboring communities, and in other communities in the Bay Area.  In 2017, U.S. News and 
World Report named the Hospital and Clinics one of the nation’s top ten on its Hospitals Honor 
Roll.  The Hospitals Honor Roll is a distinction awarded to twenty hospitals that deliver 
exceptional treatment across multiple areas of care.  

Principal Patient Services 

The Corporation provides comprehensive primary and secondary care to residents of the 
Bay Area.  In addition, the Corporation provides highly specialized referral services to patients 
residing in northern California and the surrounding regions.  See “SERVICES, FACILITIES AND 
OPERATIONS—Service Area” herein. 

Since 2001, the Corporation has concentrated its planning, development and marketing on 
five strategic clinical services (the “Strategic Clinical Services”): Cardiac Care, Cancer Treatment, 
Solid Organ Transplantation (Abdominal), Orthopedics and Neurosciences.  Historically, these 
services have been strengths of both the Hospital and Clinics and the School of Medicine.  Such 
services are intensively focused on research and innovation, both strengths of the Corporation in 
management’s view, and many procedures in these services lines are eligible for higher than 
average payments from third-party payors.  Management planning, development and marketing 
efforts are directed toward sustaining the Hospital and Clinics as a leading center in the United 
States in each of these Strategic Clinical Services.  Brief descriptions of the five Strategic Clinical 
Services follow.  For additional information on utilization of the Strategic Clinical Services for the 
three years ended August 31, 2017, see “Utilization” herein. 

Cardiac Care.  The Hospital and Clinics are a referral center for the medical and surgical 
treatment of end-stage heart failure and aortic disease.  Treatments available at the Hospital and 
Clinics include heart, heart/lung and lung transplants, aortic surgery, revascularization, 
implantation of mechanical pumps to replace heart muscle function as a temporary bridge to 



A-8 
 

transplant and as a permanent therapy, stent placement, catheter ablation, internal cardioverter 
defibrillators and other electrophysiology treatments for heart rhythm problems, minimally 
invasive heart surgery and cardiac imaging.  Breakthrough therapies, including new interventional 
devices to treat coronary artery disease and heart failure and to prolong the quality of heart muscle 
function, have also been developed as a part of this Strategic Clinical Service. 

Cancer Treatment.  The Corporation offers a multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis 
and treatment of cancer, which brings together practitioners from a number of specialties, 
including medical and surgical specialties, radiation oncology, radiology and pathology.  Specialty 
services include the treatment of cancers of the breast, gastrointestinal tract, head and neck, lung, 
and genitourinary tract, and gynecologic cancers, sarcoma and melanoma, as well as leukemia, 
lymphoma, and multiple myeloma.  The bone marrow transplant program, specializing in the 
treatment of leukemia, Hodgkin’s disease and lymphomas, is a significant part of the cancer 
treatment program.  Many cancer treatments, particularly chemotherapy, are now performed in the 
Hospital’s ambulatory infusion treatment area, which is open 365 days a year.  Treatment of brain 
cancer is also provided and is described below under “Neurosciences.”  The cancer clinical trials 
office oversees more than 250 active cancer-related clinical trials providing patients access to 
experimental treatments.  In July 2015, the Corporation began serving patients in the Stanford 
South Bay Cancer Center, an outpatient cancer center located in San Jose.  The Stanford South 
Bay Cancer Center has expanded patient access to the latest advances in cancer care, including 
access to clinical trials, and treatments in complementary practices. 

Solid Organ Transplantation (Abdominal).  Services provided include kidney, 
simultaneous kidney/pancreas, pancreas, liver and intestinal transplantation.  Such surgical 
transplantation services are in addition to heart, heart/lung and lung transplant services described 
above under “Cardiac Care.”  All transplant programs utilize multi-disciplinary teams comprised 
of experts in transplant surgery, immunology and infectious disease.  Patients benefit from research 
protocols and receive care and education from specialty-trained bedside nurses, transplant 
coordinators, social workers and rehabilitation personnel. 

Orthopedics.  Services provided include total joint replacements, sports medicine, hand 
and upper extremities, foot and ankle, spine, trauma, tumor, and physiatry.  The adult 
reconstructive team, also known as the total joint replacement team, develops and implements the 
protocols for recovery and return to productivity.  The team also provides the latest in spine surgery 
to enable high degrees of mobility for patients who are otherwise immobilized through injury or 
pain and works closely with the multi-disciplinary teams of rehabilitation services and pain 
management experts to serve the patient from pre-surgery through post-surgical recovery.  The 
Outpatient Center, which opened in February 2009, supports continued growth and expansion in 
the scope of the Corporation’s orthopedic services and gives the Corporation an opportunity to 
develop and implement additional innovations in orthopedic care. 

Neurosciences.  Development of treatments for diseases of the brain is emphasized at the 
Hospital and Clinics.  Neurosurgeons, neurologists, radiologists and other specialists collaborate 
at the Hospital to design and develop these treatments.  Brain tumor patients have access to 
chemotherapy, biologic agent therapy and gene therapy, as well as radiation therapy, including 
CyberKnife (developed by School of Medicine faculty at the Hospital) for deep-seated brain 
tumors and brain metastases.  An extensive cerebro-vascular surgery program, including neuro-
interventional radiology, treats patients with aneurysms, complex vascular malformations, and 



A-9 
 

stroke.  The Corporation also offers medical and neurosurgical treatments for intractable epilepsy, 
aggressive acute treatment of stroke, movement disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, spine care, 
pain management, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other neuromuscular 
disorders.  In January 2016, the Corporation opened, adjacent to the Hospital campus, the Stanford 
Neuroscience Health Center, which brings together multidisciplinary teams of clinicians, 
integrated outpatient services, and advanced neuroscience technology in one patient-centered 
facility. 

Other Clinical Services.  The Corporation is, in the view of management, a recognized 
leader in providing a number of other services, including primary care and internal medicine, 
treatment of asthma, treatment of blood disorders, management of critical care patients, 
dermatologic care for complex skin disorders and vascular malformations, diagnostic radiology, 
endocrinology, endocrine surgery, gastrointestinal medicine and surgery, genetics, care for hearing 
disorders and cochlear implants, treatment of hepatobiliary disease, HIV care, treatment of 
immunological disorders, treatment of female and male infertility, laboratory medicine and 
pathology, laparoscopic surgery, major joint replacements, maxillo/craniofacial surgery, 
nephrology, ophthalmology, pain management, psychiatry, interventional and neurointerventional 
radiology, rehabilitation, rheumatology and treatment of bone malformation and disease, plastic 
surgery, pulmonary medicine and treatment for sleep disorders, surgery for scoliosis and other 
spinal disorders, sports medicine, urology, vascular medicine and surgery and women’s health. 

SHC’s Long-Range Master Plan and Additional Capital Needs 

The Master Plan.  The Corporation’s master plan for facilities replacement and renewal 
(the “Master Plan”) is anticipated to be completed in multiple phases under a thirty-year 
development agreement among the City of Palo Alto, the Corporation, LPCH, and Stanford 
University that governs local entitlements.  As part of the Master Plan, the Corporation is 
constructing the New Stanford Hospital, to consist of approximately 1.1 million square feet of 
inpatient facilities, including new surgical operating, diagnostic and treatment suites, a new 
emergency department and associated nursing and support space.  Additional new construction 
includes approximately 429,000 square feet of clinics, medical offices, and administrative offices.  
Taken together, these new facilities will replace approximately 700,000 square feet of existing 
facilities, resulting in a net increase of approximately 824,000 square feet of facilities.  
Construction activities have been planned to permit inpatient and outpatient services to continue 
during each phase of the Master Plan. 

The New Stanford Hospital is a core element of the Master Plan.  The goal of the New 
Stanford Hospital, endorsed by the Corporation’s Board and embodied in the facilities design, is 
to create a place of healing that supports patient care, practitioner and staff productivity and 
environmental sustainability.  The New Stanford Hospital is designed to create physical 
connections that foster inter-connectivity among the facility components, both expressing and 
enabling the translational medicine activities of the Corporation, the School of Medicine and 
LPCH.  The New Stanford Hospital has also been designed to support growth of the Strategic 
Clinical Services and other tertiary services and to meet the standards of the Seismic Safety Act 
(defined below).  Construction began in 2012 and is scheduled to be completed in late 2018 or 
early 2019, with transition to the New Stanford Hospital scheduled to occur during 2019.  Upon 
completion, the New Stanford Hospital and the renovated portions of the existing Hospital will 
include approximately 600 patient beds. 



A-10 
 

Management currently estimates the cost of the New Stanford Hospital to be approximately 
$2.1 billion, of which approximately $1.5 billion has been spent as of August 31, 2017.  Funding 
sources for the New Stanford Hospital include cash flows from operations, investment income, 
debt and philanthropy.  Management currently estimates that total expenditures for on-campus 
capital improvements related to the Master Plan, including the approximately $600 million of 
remaining expenditures on the New Stanford Hospital, will be approximately $1.7 billion over the 
next four fiscal years.  Management also estimates that an additional $700 million will be spent on 
various off-campus capital projects and strategic initiatives over the next four fiscal years.  
Potential off-campus projects may include the expansion of existing and acquisition of new off-
campus facilities, all of which are subject to approval by the Board.  Capital plan expenditures 
remain subject to changes by management and are subject to the review and approval of the Board 
in light of the priorities, debt capacity and the strategic planning of the Corporation and the School 
of Medicine. 

Seismic Safety Act Compliance.  California’s Hospital Seismic Safety Act (the “Seismic 
Safety Act”) requires licensed acute care functions to be conducted only in facilities that meet 
specified seismic safety standards.  Facilities classified by the State of California as non-compliant 
must be retrofitted, replaced or removed from acute care service by applicable deadlines, subject 
to extension if approved by the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development 
(“OSHPD”).  OSHPD has classified a substantial portion of the Hospital as compliant with seismic 
safety structural standards until 2030 and beyond.  Certain patient care activities are located in 
facilities that are structurally compliant until 2030.  However, these facilities have utility and other 
connections to facilities that are only compliant until 2020 under prescribed circumstances.  
Certain non-inpatient buildings are only compliant until 2020.  The Corporation received an 
OSHPD-approved extension through January 1, 2020 and management expects some non-
inpatient facilities to be in compliance by such date.  Additionally, certain nursing units and the 
perioperative suite in the Hospital cannot be completed until the New Stanford Hospital opens, 
and therefore will not be compliant by January 1, 2020.  Management intends to seek, and expects 
to receive, from OSHPD an extension of the compliance date through January 1, 2023 for these 
facilities. 

The School of Medicine 

The School of Medicine was established in 1908 as a part of Stanford University and today 
is one of the preeminent schools of medicine in the United States.  In 2017, U.S. News and World 
Report ranked the School of Medicine second nationally among research-oriented medical schools 
based upon peer assessment surveys.  The School of Medicine offers an M.D. program, M.A. and 
Ph.D. programs in various areas of biosciences, intern and residency programs at the Hospital and 
Clinics and LPCH, and a Medical Scientist Program in which students earn both an M.D. and 
Ph.D. 

The mission statement of the School of Medicine is in part “…to be a premier research-
intensive medical school that improves health through leadership and a collaborative approach to 
discovery and innovation in patient care, education and research….”  A specific strategic goal of 
the School of Medicine is to be a leader in the clinical application of knowledge acquired and 
scientific innovations achieved through research at the School of Medicine.  The Hospital and 
Clinics provides the settings where these clinical applications are delivered to adult patients. 



A-11 
 

Joint Strategic Initiatives.  The School of Medicine and the Corporation collaborate on 
strategies addressing areas of clinical excellence, patient satisfaction and business operations, and 
on a variety of initiatives in translational medicine. 

Collaborations between the School of Medicine and the Corporation include: 

 A Council of Clinical Chairs, co-chaired by the Senior Associate Dean for Clinical 
Affairs of the School of Medicine and the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer.  
The Council includes the chairs of the 18 clinical science departments of the School 
of Medicine as well as key officers of the Corporation. 

 Joint planning involving the School of Medicine, other components of Stanford 
University and the Corporation to integrate the clinical services, business needs and 
information technology priorities. 

 Coordination of development and philanthropy for the mutual benefit of the two 
institutions. 

 Collaboration in protecting the privacy and security of patient health information. 

 Clinical Services and outreach clinics with select community hospitals. 

 Collaboration regarding health care reform and medical center strategy. 

The School of Medicine has undertaken to improve the position of SHC in the Strategic 
Clinical Services and other tertiary and quaternary services.  The School of Medicine has created 
five institutes that align research, education and clinical efforts, including the Stanford Cancer 
Institute; the Stanford Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine; the Stanford 
Cardiovascular Institute; the Stanford Neuroscience Institute; and the Stanford Institute for 
Immunity, Transplantation and Infection. 

Operational Relationships Among the Corporation, Stanford University, LPCH and UHA 

Purchased Services from the School of Medicine.  Services provided at the Hospital and 
Clinics by the School of Medicine include emergency room physician coverage, medical direction 
and professional clinical services, which are delivered pursuant to a Professional Services 
Agreement (“PSA”) between the Corporation and the School of Medicine.  The expenses for these 
services are included in purchased services in the consolidated statements of operations and 
changes in net assets of the Corporation, included as Appendix B to this Official Statement, and 
were $678.2 million for the year ended August 31, 2017. 

The compensation methodology in the PSA is based on productivity and degree of 
complexity of the clinical procedures performed.  Under the PSA, the payment to the School of 
Medicine is calculated using the volume of clinical work relative value units.  As the School of 
Medicine achieves the strategic goal of seeing more patients, it is expected that the payment to the 
School of Medicine for services will increase. 

Other Transactions with Stanford University.  Services provided to the Corporation by 
Stanford University include telecommunications, transportation, utilities, and certain 
administrative services, which include legal and internal audit.  The Corporation’s cost of such 



A-12 
 

services for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017 was $99.6 million and is reflected in various 
expense categories in the consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets. 

The Corporation also received payment for services provided to Stanford University, 
including primarily building maintenance, housekeeping, and security.  Costs incurred by the 
Corporation in providing these services are reflected in the respective categories in the 
consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets.  Reimbursement from Stanford 
University totaled $38.1 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017, and is reflected in the 
consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets as expense recoveries. 

The Corporation received certain grant monies for clinical trials from Stanford University 
that totaled $6.8 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017 and are reflected in the 
consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets as net patient service revenue and 
recoveries.  For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017, the Corporation transferred $69.4 million 
to Stanford University to support the academic mission of the School of Medicine and its 
initiatives, and to generally support the academic community and physical plant of Stanford 
University.  The Corporation’s transfers to Stanford University are reflected in the consolidated 
statements of operations and changes in net assets as transfers to Stanford University. 

Transactions with LPCH.  The Corporation and LPCH share certain departments, 
including facilities design and construction, materials management, managed care contracting, 
compliance and general services.  The costs for these shared services are allocated between the 
Corporation and LPCH based on negotiated rates.  For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017, the 
total cost of shared services departments was approximately $410.2 million, of which $31.4 
million was reimbursed by LPCH.  The reimbursement from LPCH is reflected in the consolidated 
statements of operations and changes in net assets as expense recoveries. 

The Corporation also provides various services to LPCH, including operating room 
facilities and services, cardiac catheterization, interventional radiology, radiation oncology and 
laboratory services.  The Corporation charges LPCH for the services and products purchased by 
LPCH based on either (i) a percentage of charges intended to approximate actual cost or (ii) on the 
basis of actual cost per procedure.  Reimbursement from LPCH for purchased services provided 
by the Corporation totaled $44.8 million for the year ended August 31, 2017 and is reflected in the 
consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets as net patient service revenue. 

Other services provided by the Corporation to LPCH include services provided by interns 
and residents, certain billings and collections services, building maintenance and utilities.  
Reimbursement of these services totaled $40.7 million for the year ended August 31, 2017, and is 
reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets as expense 
recoveries. 

Transactions with UHA.  The Corporation has agreed to sponsor UHA’s operating 
divisions comprised of multi-specialty clinics operated by UHA in 70 locations in San Mateo, 
Santa Clara and Alameda counties, and in connection with such sponsorship the Corporation has 
agreed to fund UHA’s general overhead costs and to supplement the operating division’s revenues 
if necessary to fund its operating and capital costs.  The sponsorship continues from year to year 
at SHC’s discretion.  In fiscal year 2017, the Corporation provided $73.6 million to UHA in 
funding for operations and capital.  Management of the Corporation estimates that transfers of 



A-13 
 

such sponsorship amounts will not be material to the financial condition of the Corporation.  See 
“SERVICES, FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS—Community Physician Network” below.

As indicated in the Case Mix Index data in Table 6, the Corporation has a higher Case Mix 
Index than each hospital identified as a competitor in the Local Market; such competitor hospitals 
tend to receive lower complexity and intensity cases, as reflected in the relatively lower Case Mix 
Index for those hospitals.  While providing a significant amount of care at this level, the 
Corporation also provides care to patients whose cases are classified as high acuity and complex 



A-20 
 

cases in and near the Local Market, many of which are transferred to the Hospital from other local 
hospitals.  In large part, the most acute and difficult cases come to the Hospital because the 
Hospital and UCSF Medical Center are the only two hospitals in the Bay Area to offer many of 
the treatments and procedures necessary for these patients.  Management’s strategic decision to 
concentrate on the five Strategic Clinical Services reflects its opinion that higher acuity services 
will produce higher operating margins than lower acuity services. 

Market Strategy 

The Corporation’s strategic plan calls for near-term growth in its Strategic Clinical 
Services as well as other services in which the Corporation has demonstrated distinction.  The 
Corporation focuses on aligning these specific services with relevant markets, based on an 
evaluation of various factors, including the type of services already available in such markets.  This 
strategy is intended to promote growth in higher acuity inpatient and outpatient procedures.  A 
principal focus of the strategic plan is the five Strategic Clinical Services: Cardiac Care, Cancer 
Treatment, Solid Organ Transplantation (Abdominal), Orthopedics and Neurosciences.  The 
Corporation’s goal is to grow inpatient and outpatient volume and expand national and 
international distinction in these services.  The growth strategy is based on leveraging the 
Corporation’s clinical innovations in these services.  See “SERVICES, FACILITIES AND 
OPERATIONS—The School of Medicine” herein.  The growth strategy also provides for more 
rapid translation of faculty research into clinical care.  Leverage strategies are expected to be 
tailored to the opportunities in each market and are expected to include selective partnering with 
other institutions, management of subspecialty services for other institutions, development of 
outreach infrastructures that include both on-site and web-based delivery of care, and expanded 
contracting with payers for selected clinical services. 

From time to time the Corporation evaluates and pursues potential acquisition, merger and 
affiliation candidates as part of the overall strategic planning and development process, which 
includes strengthening the Corporation’s presence in Local and Regional Markets.  Because of the 
integration occurring throughout the health care industry, the Corporation may consider such 
transactions if there is a perceived strategic or operational benefit for the Corporation. 

In management’s view, the Corporation’s affiliation with ValleyCare plays a key role in 
its market positioning.  The affiliation with ValleyCare has extended the Corporation’s network of 
health care providers, clinical outreach and community services into the East Bay portion of the 
Corporation’s Regional Market, supporting the Corporation’s academic endeavors in population 
health sciences and clinical research and providing an outreach location for academic service lines. 

The Corporation’s strategic plan also envisions sustaining and increasing the share of the 
Corporation’s patient care volume and revenue derived from higher-complexity tertiary and 
quaternary cases in the Regional, California, National and International markets, while 
strengthening the Corporation’s presence in the Local Market through delivery of outpatient 
subspecialty services in selected local communities. 

The following strategies of the Corporation and the School of Medicine are intended to 
increase higher-complexity tertiary and quaternary cases: 



A-21 
 

 Developing more complex treatments and therapies in both inpatient and outpatient 
settings. 

 Focusing on the more complex and challenging treatment modalities within the 
Strategic Clinical Services. 

 Focusing growth strategies on new services and more advanced treatments and 
methodologies. 

Current actions being taken to implement these strategies include: 

 In the Cardiac Care Strategic Clinical Service, concentrating on more complex and 
difficult revascularization procedures, such as coronary artery bypass graft and 
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty procedures. 

 In the Cancer Treatment Strategic Clinical Service, emphasizing the distinctive 
treatments provided by the Corporation, including bone marrow transplants, radiation 
therapy, and minimally invasive surgery techniques. 

 In the Solid Organ Transplantation (Abdominal) Strategic Clinical Service, 
emphasizing living donor approaches in liver transplantation and new immuno-
suppressant therapies, as organ supply permits. 

 In the Orthopedic Strategic Clinical Service, emphasizing total joint replacements, 
sports medicine, hand and upper extremities, foot and ankle, spine, trauma, tumor, and 
physiatry.  

 In the Neurosciences Strategic Clinical Service, emphasizing chemo, biologic agent 
and gene and radiation therapies, including the CyberKnife, for spine care and neuro-
oncology. 

Community Physician Network 

In 2011, the Corporation and Stanford University, acting on behalf of its School of 
Medicine, formed UHA to operate clinics staffed by a network of community-based physicians.  
These community-based clinics are staffed by community physicians, complementing the faculty 
practice clinics operated by the Corporation and staffed by members of the faculty of the School 
of Medicine.  UHA’s community-based clinic network began in 2011 with two clinics in Menlo 
Park, California, and as of August 2017 consists of over 70 clinic sites located in San Mateo, Santa 
Clara and Alameda counties.  Clinic services are provided through long-term professional services 
agreements between UHA and community-based physicians, who are affiliated with UHA through 
operating divisions associated with the physicians’ medical groups.  The Corporation provides 
financial support for the operating divisions of UHA under sponsorship agreements.  See 
“SERVICES, FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS—Operational Relationships Among the 
Corporation, Stanford University, LPCH and UHA” above.  As new operating divisions are added, 
the Corporation may enter into additional sponsorship arrangements with UHA in support of 
expanding the network of community-based clinics operated by UHA.  In a related effort, the 
Corporation is in discussions with other community-based physicians regarding extending the 
Corporation’s electronic medical record system to community physician practices.

SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

All financial information presented in this section, “SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL 
INFORMATION,” is presented on a consolidated basis.  The following consolidated statements 
of operations and changes in net assets of the Corporation for the fiscal years ended August 31, 
2015, 2016 and 2017 have been derived by the Corporation’s management from the audited 
consolidated financial statements of the Corporation.  All financial information presented in this 
section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
thereto for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2017, included as Appendix B to this

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Recent Financial Performance 

Accounting Policies; Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and 
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
during the reporting period. 

Management evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis and makes changes to the 
estimates as new information becomes available.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

The most significant estimates relate to patient accounts receivable allowances, amounts 
due to third party payors, retirement plan obligations, and self-insurance reserves.  For additional 
information on the Corporation’s use of estimates, see the notes to the audited consolidated 
financial statements of the Corporation included in Appendix B to this Official Statement. 

Recent Initiatives and Programs 

Recent initiatives include: (i) continued construction of the New Stanford Hospital, which 
is scheduled to be completed by late 2018 or early 2019 with capital spending of $1.5 billion as of 
August 31, 2017; and (ii) investments in new site openings and service expansions, including the 
Center for Academic Medicine on Stanford University’s campus, which will provide offices for 
School of Medicine clinical faculty, researchers and administration, and SHC Emeryville, an 
outpatient center offering primary and specialty care in multiple medical specialties. 

Three Year Historical Performance Overview 

For the three years ended August 31, 2017, the Corporation’s overall financial performance 
strengthened despite challenges, enhancing its ability to support investments in the facilities and 
systems required to remain at the forefront of medicine and to be the provider of choice for 
complex care in the communities it serves.  Higher patient revenues and improved financial market 
conditions contributed to the Corporation’s strengthened financial position.  Cumulative operating 
revenues for the three years ended August 31, 2017 were $12.1 billion, of which net patient service 
revenue less provision for doubtful accounts accounted for 95% of this total.  Cumulative income 
from operations before investment income for the three years ended August 31, 2017 was $664 
million.  Cumulative interest and investment income and change in the value of SHC’s share of 
the Stanford University managed investment pools for the three years ended August 31, 2017 was 
$268 million.  Cumulative increase in net assets for the three years ended August 31, 2017 was 
$817 million.  Cumulative capital expenditures for the three years ended August 31, 2017 were 
approximately $1.7 billion. 

Financial Performance in Fiscal Year 2017 Compared to Fiscal Year 2016 

The Corporation’s net assets increased $451 million, from $3,054 million as of August 31, 
2016, to $3,505 million as of August 31, 2017.  In fiscal year 2017, the Corporation generated a 
$485 million excess of revenues over expenses compared to a $70 million excess of revenues over 



A-26 
 

expenses in fiscal year 2016.  Interest and investment income and change in value of SHC’s share 
of the Stanford University managed investment pools increased by $122 million in fiscal year 
2017, resulting in a gain of $160 million due to positive returns on these investments. 

Net patient service revenue less provision for doubtful accounts (including the payments 
under UHA’s capitated agreements with health maintenance organizations (the “Premium 
Revenue”)) increased by 8.8%, from $4.0 billion in fiscal year 2016, to $4.3 billion in fiscal year 
2017.  Of this $4.3 billion, inpatient revenues were 42% and grew by 3.7% on continuing increases 
in patient volume.  Outpatient revenues increased by 12.8%, accounting for the remaining 58% of 
the $4.3 billion.  Operating expenses increased 6.9% in fiscal year 2017 to $4.2 billion, from $3.9 
billion in fiscal year 2016.  Salaries and benefits increased 7.4% to $1,986 million in response to 
growth in patient volumes and to maintain SHC’s position in the competitive market for health 
care professionals.  All other operating expenses were up 6.4%, from $2,099 million in fiscal year 
2016, to $2,234 million in fiscal year 2017 largely as a result of costs related to the increase in 
patient activity, payments to Stanford University under a funds flow agreement for clinical services 
provided by the School of Medicine, and inflation increases.  Excluding revenues and expenses 
from the Hospital Fee Program, net patient service revenue less provision for doubtful accounts 
increased 9.1%, or $351 million, while operating expenses increased 7%, or $275 million in fiscal 
year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. 

Financial Performance in Fiscal Year 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year 2015 

The Corporation’s net assets decreased $6 million, from $3,060 million as of August 31, 
2015, to $3,054 million as of August 31, 2016.  In fiscal year 2016, the Corporation generated a 
$70 million excess of revenues over expenses compared to $389 million in fiscal year 2015.  
Although interest and investment income and change in value of SHC’s share of Stanford 
University managed investment pools decreased by $32 million in fiscal year 2016, the 
Corporation still had a gain of $38 million due to positive returns on these investments. 

Net patient service revenue less provision for doubtful accounts (including Premium 
Revenue) increased by 14.7%, from $3.5 billion in fiscal year 2015, to $4.0 billion in fiscal year 
2016.  Of this $4.0 billion, inpatient revenues were 44% and grew by 6% on continuing increases 
in patient volume.  Outpatient revenues increased by 22.5%, accounting for the remaining 56% of 
the $4.0 billion.  Operating expenses increased 20.1% in fiscal year 2016, from $3.3 billion in 
fiscal year 2015, to $3.9 billion.  Salaries and benefits increased 29.6%, from $1,428 million in 
fiscal year 2015, to $1,850 million in fiscal year 2016 in response to growth in patient volumes.  
All other operating expenses combined increased 12.8%, from $1,861 million in fiscal year 2015, 
to $2,099 million in fiscal year 2016 largely as a result of costs related to increased patient activity, 
payments to Stanford University under a funds flow agreement for clinical services provided by 
the School of Medicine, and acquisition of the Stanford Blood Center.  Excluding revenues and 
expenses from the Hospital Fee Program, net patient service revenue less provision for doubtful 
accounts increased 16.7%, or $548 million, while operating expenses increased 21.4%, or $689 
million in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015. 



A-27 
 

Financial Performance in Fiscal Year 2015 Compared to Fiscal Year 2014 

The Corporation’s net assets increased $373 million, from $2,687 million as of August 31, 
2014, to $3,060 million as of August 31, 2015.  In fiscal year 2015, the Corporation generated a 
$389 million excess of revenues over expenses compared to $432 million in fiscal year 2014.  
Although interest and investment income and change in value of SHC’s share of Stanford 
University managed investment pools decreased by $121 million from the fiscal year ended August 
31, 2014, the Corporation still had a gain of $70 million due to positive returns on these 
investments. 

Net patient service revenue less provision for doubtful accounts (including Premium 
Revenue) increased by 19.2%, from $2.9 billion in fiscal year 2014, to $3.5 billion in fiscal year 
2015.  Of this $3.5 billion, inpatient revenues were 47% and grew by 20.8% on continuing 
increases in patient volume.  Outpatient revenues increased by 17.8%, accounting for the 
remaining 53% of the $3.5 billion.  Operating expenses increased 20.9% in fiscal year 2015, from 
$2.7 billion in fiscal year 2014, to $3.3 billion.  Salaries and benefits increased 15.9% from $1,232 
million in fiscal year 2014 to $1,428 million in fiscal year 2015 in response to growth in patient 
volumes and the competitive market for health care professionals.  All other operating expenses 
combined increased 25.1%, from $1,488 million in fiscal year 2014, to $1,861 million in fiscal 
year 2015 largely as a result of costs related to the increase in patient activity and expanded clinical 
services.  Excluding revenues and expenses from the Hospital Fee Program, net patient service 
revenue less provision for doubtful accounts increased 16.3%, or $460 million, while operating 
expenses increased 18.5%, or $503 million in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. 

Pension Funding Requirements 

The majority of the Corporation’s eligible employees are covered by the Corporation’s 
403(b) Retirement Plan, which is a defined contribution plan.  Contributions are based on a 
percentage of an eligible employee’s annual compensation. 

In addition, certain employees are covered by a noncontributory defined benefit plan, the 
Staff Pension Plan (the “SPP”), that was closed to new participants in 1997.  Benefits are based on 
years of service and an employee’s compensation.  Contributions to the plan are based on 
actuarially determined amounts sufficient to meet the benefits to be paid to plan participants.  The 
financial performance of pension fund investments of the SPP can have a significant impact on the 
amount of pension expense and the recorded pension liability, as well as the amount and timing of 
pension contributions.  Other factors can also have a significant impact on pension expense and 
contributions, such as interest rate levels and salary inflation.  Taken together, these factors can 
have a material impact on both the results of operations and liquidity.  As of August 31, 2017, the 
SPP had a net benefit liability recognized in the amount of $52 million. 

The Corporation contributed $34.8 million in September 2017 to the SPP to eliminate 
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation variable rate premium fees.  The Corporation’s funded 
status with respect to the SPP is estimated at 93% as of September 30, 2017.  The funded status 
assumes a discount rate of 3.56%.  The Corporation’s investment policy is dictated by a glide path 
that increases the plan’s fixed income allocation as the plan’s funded status increases.  The 



A-28 
 

Corporation’s investment policy for the SPP assets targets a portfolio mix of 40% equity and 60% 
long-term debt. 

The Corporation also provides post-retirement health insurance coverage through the 
Postretirement Medical Benefit Plan (the “PMBP”) for employees meeting specific criteria.  As of 
August 31, 2017, the Corporation recognized a net benefit liability of $66 million for the PMBP, 
recorded as a liability within self-insurance reserves and other on the Corporation’s consolidated 
balance sheets. 

For additional information on the Corporation’s retirement plans and the PMBP, see Note 
10 of the audited consolidated financial statements of the Corporation included as Appendix B to 
this Official Statement.

Interest Rate Swap Arrangements 

The Corporation enters into interest rate swap contracts (“Swaps”) from time to time to 
increase or decrease its variable rate debt exposure and to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and 
floating rate indebtedness.  As of August 31, 2017, the Corporation had nine floating-to-fixed rate 
Swaps outstanding, representing a total notional amount of $575.8 million, under which the 
Corporation pays a fixed rate and receives a variable rate from the swap counterparty.  Each of the 
Swaps may be terminated by the Corporation at its option at any time.  Swap counterparties may 
also terminate Swaps upon the occurrence of certain “termination events” or “events of default.”  
If either the Corporation or a counterparty terminates a Swap with a negative market value, the 
Corporation may be required to make a termination payment to such counterparty, and such 
payment could be material in amount.  The estimated fair values of the Swaps are determined using 
available market information and valuation methodologies.  The Corporation recognizes changes 
in the fair value of Swaps in excess (deficiency) of revenue over expenses.  As of August 31, 2017, 
the Corporation’s mark-to-market liability on the Swaps totaled $246.0 million.  In addition, the 
Corporation is required to post collateral under two of its Swaps to secure its obligations to the 
Swap counterparty when the counterparty’s exposure exceeds certain stated thresholds.  As of 
August 31, 2017 the Corporation had $10.1 million in cash posted with one counterparty.  See 
Note 2 and Note 9 of the audited consolidated financial statements of the Corporation included in 
Appendix B to this Official Statement for more information related to the Corporation’s Swaps.  
The Corporation’s regularly scheduled payments with respect to the Swaps are secured on a parity 
with debt service payments with respect to the Bonds.  See “SECURITY AND SOURCE OF 
PAYMENT FOR THE BONDS—The Master Indenture” in the forepart to this Official Statement.   

Sources of Revenue 

Payments are made to the Corporation on behalf of patients by the federal government 
under the Medicare program administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
(“CMS”) of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, by the State of California 
under the Medi-Cal program, and by certain commercial insurance and managed care programs, 
as well as by patients on their own behalf. 

The following table summarizes the percentage of gross patient revenues by source of 
payment to the Corporation for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017.  



A-32

Total 100% 100% 100% 
 
  
Source:  Corporation Records. 

Gross patient service revenue is composed of usual and customary charges for services 
provided to all patients.  Services provided to patients covered by Medicare, Medi-Cal and a 
number of managed care programs are typically paid at amounts that are less than usual and 
customary charges. 

See “BONDHOLDERS’ RISKS” in the forepart of the Official Statement for a more 
detailed discussion of the sources of revenue for the Corporation and certain other risks associated 
with certain sources of revenue. 

Arrangements with Managed Care Plans 

The Corporation maintains contracts with most managed care plans operating in Northern 
California.  Management monitors the financial performance under these contracts on a regular 
basis and pursues renegotiation when appropriate and where feasible. 

The largest volume commercial payers for the Corporation in fiscal year ended August 31, 
2017 were Anthem Blue Cross, Blue Shield of California, and UnitedHealthcare.  All commercial 
agreements are fee-for-service.  Fee-for-service reimbursement employs the traditional 
methodologies including percentage of charges, per diems, case rates, surgical schedules and stop-
loss. 

Hospital Fee Program 

State law imposes a fee on California’s general acute care hospitals, except for public 
hospitals and certain exempt hospitals (the “Hospital Fee Program”).  Proceeds of the Hospital Fee 
Program are used to earn federal matching funds for Medi-Cal.  The California Medi-Cal Hospital 
Reimbursement Initiative, or Proposition 52, passed in November 2016 and extends the Hospital 
Fee Program indefinitely.  The program is subject to CMS approval.  For more information about 
the Hospital Fee Program, see “BONDHOLDERS’ RISKS—Patient Service Revenues—
California Hospital Fee Program” in the forepart to this Official Statement. 



A-33 
 

SHC recognized $45.6, $55.2 and $103.7 million in net patient service revenue and $41.6, 
$45.8 and $73.6 million in other expense related to the Hospital Fee Program for the years ended 
August 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

See Note 3 of the audited consolidated financial statements of the Corporation included in 
Appendix B to this Official Statement for more information related to the Hospital Fee Program. 

ACCREDITATION, LICENSURE, MEDICARE AND MEDI-CAL CERTIFICATION 

The California Department of Public Health (“CDPH”) licenses the Hospital as a general 
acute care facility.  The Corporation is accredited by The Joint Commission (“TJC”), which 
conducted its last on-site survey in July 2016.  TJC conducts unannounced on-site surveys within 
a predictable timeframe based on the accreditation cycle (for example, every three years for 
hospital accreditation). 

In addition to recurring accreditation surveys by TJC, the Corporation is subject from time 
to time to incident-based surveys by CDPH, acting on behalf of CMS, to determine compliance 
with CMS Hospital Conditions of Participation (“CoP”).  If such surveys, known as “validation 
surveys,” substantiate the provider’s noncompliance with CoP, CMS has authority to require the 
provider to be surveyed by CPDH and to take other enforcement action, including termination of 
the Medicare provider agreement.  The Corporation remains a Medicare participating hospital, is 
fully licensed by CDPH and is fully accredited by TJC.  

PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY AND OTHER INSURANCE 

The Corporation maintains coverage for professional and comprehensive general liability 
and other coverages through programs of self-insurance and reinsurance.  Primary layers of such 
liability are insured through SUMIT, an insurer controlled and owned by the Corporation and 
LPCH.  SUMIT provides medical and hospital professional liability, general liability, employment 
practices liability, miscellaneous errors and omissions liability, and cyber liability to the 
Corporation and LPCH.  SUMIT provides hospital professional and medical malpractice liability 
and cyber liability to the School of Medicine (including the clinical activities of its faculty and 
residents). 

For the policy year September 1, 2016 to September 1, 2017, SUMIT retains 100% of the 
risk for the first $15 million per claim for professional and general liability losses by the 
Corporation, LPCH and the School of Medicine, with an annual policy aggregate of $25 million.  
SUMIT purchases $165 million of excess reinsurance jointly covering the Corporation, LPCH and 
the School of Medicine from various reinsurance companies rated “A” or better by A.M. Best 
rating agency.  In addition to excess reinsurance, SUMIT purchases a "buffer" that reduces 
SUMIT's liability for the first claim from $15 million to $10 million and reduces the annual policy 
aggregate from $25 million to $20 million. 

SUMIT self-insures the first $1.25 million per claim for cyber liability coverage in excess 
of $1.25 million per claim.  SUMIT purchases $50 million of excess reinsurance jointly covering 
LPCH, SHC and the Stanford School of Medicine.  For policy years prior to September 1, 2005, 
SUMIT provided occurrence-based coverage for the risk related to the primary loss layer in 
amounts varying year to year since SUMIT was established in April 2000. 



A-34 
 

In addition to SUMIT, the Corporation obtains coverage for various risks under policies 
issued by commercial insurers.  These policies typically cover LPCH as a named insured as well.  
As a result, claims brought against one named insured reduce the limits available to the other on 
each claim.  The Corporation secures the following coverage jointly with LPCH: 

 Workers’ compensation in amounts in excess of a $750,000 deductible, per claim for 
any fiscal year.  

 Property in an aggregate blanket amount of $500 million of coverage per claim with a 
$100,000 deductible, subject to various sublimits, exclusions, and terms and 
conditions for property loss caused by risks such as flood, business interruption and 
certain acts of terrorism, among others.  The Corporation does not purchase 
earthquake coverage. 

 Directors and officers (“D&O”) and employment practices liability (“EPL”) in 
aggregate of $50 million in limits subject to a self-insured D&O retention of 
$250,000 per claim and a self-insured EPL retention of $350,000 per claim, in the 
current fiscal year.   

 Terrorism coverage with $25 million in limits, subject to a $1 million retention. 

LITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS 

At any given time, the Corporation has lawsuits pending and threatened against it that may 
or may not be covered in whole or in part by insurance.  There is not now pending or threatened 
any litigation restraining or enjoining the offering of the Bonds, if issued, or questioning or 
affecting the validity of the Bonds, if issued, or the proceedings and authority under which they 
were issued.  Neither the creation, organization or existence of the Corporation nor the title of the 
present directors or officers of the Corporation to their respective offices is being contested.  The 
Corporation is not now a party to any pending litigation, and is not aware of any circumstances 
that would likely result in such litigation that in any manner questions the right of the Corporation 
to use the proceeds of the Bonds, if issued, as described in this Official Statement. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of August 31, 2017, the Corporation employed 8,925 full-time, 1,072 regular part time 
and 574 per diem/PRN (as needed) staff, equivalent to 10,571 full-time equivalent employees.  

As of August 31, 2017, the Corporation employed 3,194 full and part-time registered 
nurses.  Turnover rate for the registered nursing staff for the past twelve months was approximately 
10.9%.  

As of August 31, 2017, approximately 33% of the Corporation’s employees were covered 
by collective bargaining arrangements with two bargaining units that are represented by 
Committee for Recognition of Nursing Achievement (“CRONA”) and Service Employees 
International Union–United Healthcare Workers (“SEIU–UHW”), respectively.  The current 
CRONA contract is in effect through August 2020.  The current contract with SEIU–UHW is also 
in effect through September 2020.

Report of Independent Auditors 
 
To the Board of Directors 
Stanford Health Care 
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Stanford Health Care (“SHC”), 
which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as of August 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related 
consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets and of cash flows for the years then 
ended.   
 
Management's Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial 
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; 
this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation 
and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error. 
 
Auditors’ Responsibility 
 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements based on our audits.  
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States 
of America.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.   
 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the consolidated financial statements.  The procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to 
fraud or error.  In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to SHC's 
preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on 
the effectiveness of SHC's internal control.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also 
includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the 
consolidated financial statements.  We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 
 
Opinion 
 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material 
respects, the financial position of Stanford Health Care as of August 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results 
of its operations and changes in net assets and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance 
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1. Organization 

 
Stanford Health Care (“SHC”) operates a licensed acute care hospital (“Stanford Hospital”) and a 
cancer center in Palo Alto, California, along with numerous outpatient physician clinics in the San 
Francisco Bay Area, in community settings, and in association with regional hospitals.  Stanford 
Hospital is a principal teaching affiliate of the Stanford University School of Medicine (“SoM”) and 
provides primary and specialty health services to adults, including cardiac care, cancer treatment, 
solid organ transplantation services, neurosciences, and orthopedics services designated by 
management as SHC’s “Strategic Clinical Services”.  SHC, together with Lucile Salter Packard 
Children’s Hospital at Stanford (“LPCH”), operates the clinical settings through which the SoM 
educates medical and graduate students, trains residents and clinical fellows, supports faculty 
and community clinicians and conducts medical and biological sciences research. 
 
The Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior University (the “University”) is the sole corporate 
member of SHC and LPCH.  As part of their ongoing operations, SHC and LPCH engage in 
certain related party transactions as described further in Note 13.   
 
The consolidated financial statements include SHC’s interest in University HealthCare Alliance 
(“UHA”), The Hospital Committee for the Livermore-Pleasanton Areas (dba Stanford Health Care 
- ValleyCare) (“SHC-VC”), Stanford Blood Center, LLC (“SBC LLC”), Stanford Emanuel Radiation 
Oncology Center, LLC (“SEROC”), CareCounsel, LLC (“CareCounsel”), SUMIT Holding 
International, LLC (“SHI”), Professional Exchange Assurance Company (“PEAC”), Stanford 
Health Care Advantage (“SHC Advantage”), Stanford International Medical Services RAK FZE 
(“SIMS RAK FZE”) and Stanford Medicine International (Hong Kong) Co., Limited (“SMI Hong 
Kong”) (collectively “SHC”).   
 
UHA, a physician medical foundation, supports SHC’s mission of delivering quality care to the 
community and conducting research and education.  In addition, UHA leads the development of a 
high quality clinical delivery network, built on collaboration with and sponsorship of community 
hospitals, on behalf of the SoM, SHC, and UHA physicians.  The SoM and SHC are the members 
of UHA, and appoint directors to the governing board.  The UHA bylaws afford control to SHC.  
Effective January 1, 2011, SHC entered into a sponsorship agreement with UHA whereby SHC 
agreed to certain funding for the development and operation of UHA and continued additional 
funding for future or alternative clinical sites of UHA.  Additional funding by SHC to UHA for 
operations and capital was $73,617 and $60,118 for the years ended August 31, 2017 and 2016, 
respectively. 
 
SHC-VC, a leading community hospital system located in the East Bay’s Tri-Valley region of 
Pleasanton, Livermore and Dublin, completed an affiliation agreement with SHC effective May 18, 
2015.  SHC is the sole corporate member of SHC-VC. 
 
SBC LLC is a limited liability company organized effective July 31, 2015.  SBC LLC serves as a 
community blood center and provides blood products and testing services to hospitals, clinics, 
companies and other clients.  SHC is the sole member of SBC LLC.  On September 30, 2015, 
SBC LLC completed the acquisition of the Stanford Blood Center from the University for $36,000.  
SBC LLC paid consideration in excess of assets acquired in the amount of $31,123, which is 
recorded in Transfer to Stanford University in the consolidated statements of operations and 
changes in net assets for the year ending August 31, 2016. 
  
SEROC was originally formed as a joint venture between SHC and Emanuel Medical Center 
(“EMC”).  On July 31, 2014, EMC transferred its membership interest to Doctors Medical Center 
of Modesto, Inc. (“DMC”).  SEROC operates an outpatient clinic that provides radiation oncology 
services to patients in Turlock, California and surrounding communities.  SHC’s interest in 
SEROC was 60% for the years ended August 31, 2017 and 2016.  The remaining interest of 40% 
is recorded as a noncontrolling interest in unrestricted net assets on the consolidated balance 
sheets as of August 31, 2017 and 2016.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 
 

Basis of Presentation 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of 
accounting.  Net assets of SHC and changes therein have been classified and are reported as 
follows: 
 
� Unrestricted net assets — Unrestricted net assets represent those resources of SHC that 

are not subject to donor-imposed stipulations.  The only limits on unrestricted net assets are 
broad limits resulting from the nature of SHC and the purposes specified in its articles of 
incorporation or bylaws and, limits resulting from contractual agreements, if any. 

 
� Temporarily restricted net assets — Temporarily restricted net assets represent 

contributions, which are subject to donor-imposed restrictions that can be fulfilled by actions 
of SHC pursuant to those stipulations or by the passage of time. 

 
� Permanently restricted net assets — Permanently restricted net assets represent 

contributions that are subject to donor-imposed restrictions that they be maintained 
permanently by SHC.  Generally, the donors of these assets permit SHC to use all or part of 
the investment return on these assets. 

 
Expenses are generally reported as decreases in unrestricted net assets.  A restriction expires 
when the stipulated time period has elapsed, when the stipulated purpose for which the resource 
was restricted has been fulfilled, or both.  Temporarily restricted contributions are recorded as 
restricted revenue when received and when the restriction expires, the net assets are shown as 
released from restriction on the consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets.  
Investment income on temporarily or permanently restricted assets that is restricted by donor or 
law is recorded within the respective net asset category, and when the restriction expires, the net 
assets are shown as released from restriction. 
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents  
Cash and cash equivalents include certain investments in highly liquid debt instruments with 
original maturities of three months or less.  Cash equivalents consist primarily of demand 
deposits and money market mutual funds. 

 
Assets Limited as to Use, Held by Trustee 
Assets limited as to use include various accounts held by a trustee in accordance with indenture 
requirements.  The indenture terms require that the trustee control the expenditure of bond 
proceeds for capital projects.  Assets limited as to use consist of cash and cash equivalents and 
short-term investments, recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.  There are no amounts 
required to fund current liabilities of SHC, therefore the entire amount has been classified as long-
term in the consolidated balance sheets at August 31, 2017 and 2016.   
 
Inventories  
Inventories, which consist primarily of hospital operating supplies and pharmaceuticals, are stated 
at the lower of cost or market value determined using the first-in, first-out method. 
 
Investments  
Investments held directly by SHC consist of cash and cash equivalents, mutual funds and 
investments in non-public entities and are stated at fair value.  Fair value is determined in 
accordance with current accounting guidance as further described in Note 7.  Investment 
earnings (including realized gains and losses on investments, interest, dividends and impairment 
loss on investment securities) are included in investment income unless the income or loss is 
restricted by donor or law.  Income on investments of donor restricted funds is added to or 
deducted from the appropriate net asset category based on the donor’s restriction.  Unrestricted 
unrealized gains and losses on other than trading securities are separately reported below the 
excess of revenues over expenses.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 
 

Investments at Equity  
Investments at equity consist of investments in which SHC has ownership of 50% or less but is 
able to exercise significant influence over the investee.  These investments include Stanford-
StartX Fund, LLC (‘’StartX Fund’’), Stanford PET-CT, LLC (“PET-CT”) and Pleasanton Physician 
Affiliates II, LLC (‘’PPA II’’).  All earnings from StartX Fund and PPA II are included in earnings on 
equity method investments in the consolidated statements of operations and changes in net 
assets.  Earnings from PET-CT are included in other revenue in the consolidated statements of 
operations and changes in net assets. 
 
The mission of StartX, a California nonprofit public benefit corporation, is to accelerate the 
development of students, faculty and alumni of the University identified by StartX as high potential 
entrepreneurs through an experiential educational program.  StartX Fund is a California limited 
liability company created to support the continued experiential education of participants in the 
StartX accelerator program.  SHC’s interest in StartX Fund was 33% for the years ended August 
31, 2017 and 2016. 
 
PET-CT is a California limited liability company which provides radiological services to patients of 
the community, including patients served by SHC and physicians affiliated with the SoM.  SHC 
and the University each appoint one-half of the members of the governing board of PET-CT and 
are its only members.  SHC’s interest in PET-CT was 50% for the years ended August 31, 2017 
and 2016.   
 
PPA II is a California limited liability company which owns and operates a medical office building 
in Pleasanton.  SHC-VC’s interest in PPA II was 39% for the years ended August 31, 2017 and 
2016.   
 
Investments in University Managed Pools  
Investments in University managed pools consist of funds invested in the University’s Merged 
Pool (“MP”) and Expendable Funds Pool (“EFP”) (collectively the “Pools”).  Under the terms of 
SHC’s agreement with the University, the University has discretion to invest the funds in the 
Pools.  SHC may deposit funds in the Pools at its discretion.  Withdrawals from the MP and EFP 
require advance notice to the University.  The value of its share of the Pools is determined by the 
University and is based on the fair value of the underlying assets in the Pools.  
 
The University allocates investment earnings to SHC from the University managed pools based 
on SHC’s share of the Pools.  Earnings include interest, dividends, distributions, investment gains 
and losses, and the increases or decreases in the value of SHC’s share of the pools.  All 
investment gains and losses and increases and decreases in share value are treated as realized 
and included in the excess of revenues over expenses.  
 
The increases or decreases in the value of SHC’s share of the Pools are recorded as income and 
gains on University managed pools unless the income is restricted by donor or law.  Income on 
investments of donor restricted funds invested in the University managed pools is added to or 
deducted from the appropriate net asset category based on the donor’s restriction.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 
 

Property and Equipment  
Property and equipment are stated at cost except for donated assets, which are recorded at fair 
market value at the date of donation.  Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment is 
determined using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are 
as follows: 

 
Land improvements 10 to 25 years 
Buildings and leasehold improvements 7 to 40 years 
Equipment 3 to 20 years 

 
Significant replacements and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs, 
which do not improve or extend the life of the respective assets, are charged to expense as 
incurred.  Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life or 
term of the lease.  Upon sale or disposal of property and equipment, the cost and accumulated 
depreciation are removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is included in the 
consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets.   
 
Equipment includes medical equipment, furniture and fixtures and computer software and 
hardware. 
 
Equipment under capital leases is recorded at present value at the inception of the leases and is 
amortized on the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful 
life of the equipment.  The amortization of the assets recorded under capital leases is included in 
depreciation and amortization expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of 
operations and changes in net assets. 
 
Interest costs incurred on borrowed funds during the period of construction of capital assets is 
capitalized, net of any interest earned, as a component of the cost of acquiring those assets. 
 
Asset Retirement Obligations 
Asset retirement obligations (“ARO”) are legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-
lived assets.  These liabilities are initially recorded at fair value as other long-term liabilities and 
the related asset retirement costs are capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related 
assets by the same amount as the liability.  Asset retirement costs are subsequently accreted 
over the useful lives of the related assets.  SHC recorded current period accretion expense of 
$397 and $377 in the consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets for the 
years ended August 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  ARO liability of $8,265 and $7,868 is 
included in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of August 31, 2017 
and 2016, respectively. 
 
Other Assets 
Other assets include long-term portion of contributions receivable, intangible assets, and other 
long-term assets.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 
 
Contributions Receivable  
Unconditional promises to give (“contributions”) are recorded at fair value at the date the promise 
is received.  Donations for specific purposes are reported as either temporarily or permanently 
restricted net assets.  Contributions to be received after one year are discounted at an 
appropriate discount rate commensurate with the risks involved and applicable to the years in 
which the promises are received, and recorded in their respective net asset category.  In 
accordance with current accounting guidance, the discount rates were determined using the risk 
free rate adjusted for the risk of donor default.  Current and long-term portions of contributions 
receivable are included in other receivables and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets, 
respectively, and contribution revenue is included in the financial statements in the appropriate 
net asset category.  Amortization of the discount is included in contributions and other in the 
consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets.  Conditional promises to give 
are recognized when the condition is substantially met.      
 
Premiums, Discounts and Deferred Financing Costs on Long-Term Debt  
Premiums and discounts arising from the original issuance of long-term debt are amortized on 
either the effective interest method or the straight-line basis, which approximates the effective 
interest method, over the life of the debt.  The unamortized portion of these premiums and 
discounts are included in long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets.  Deferred financing 
costs represent costs incurred in conjunction with the issuance of SHC’s long-term debt.  These 
costs are amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest method, 
over the life of the debt. 

 
Interest Rate Swap Agreements  
SHC has entered into several interest rate swap agreements to reduce the effect of interest rate 
fluctuation on its variable rate bonds.  All swaps are recognized on the consolidated balance 
sheets at their fair value in accordance with current accounting guidance.  Changes in the fair 
value of interest rate swaps are included in excess of revenues over expenses.  The net cash 
payments or receipts under the interest rate swap agreements have been recorded as an 
increase (decrease) to interest expense.  

 
Excess of Revenues over Expenses 
The consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets include excess of revenues 
over expenses.  Changes in unrestricted net assets which are excluded from excess of revenues 
over expenses, include transfers of assets to and from affiliates for other than goods and 
services, change in unrealized gains and losses on marketable investments, contributions of 
long-lived assets (including assets acquired using contributions which by donor restriction were to 
be used for the purposes of acquiring such assets), changes in pension and postretirement 
liability and other changes related to noncontrolling interests. 
 
Net Patient Service Revenue  
Net patient service revenue is reported at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients, 
third-party payers including Medicare and Medi-Cal, and others for services rendered, including 
estimated retroactive audit adjustments under reimbursement agreements with third-party payers.  
Retroactive adjustments are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the related services are 
rendered and adjusted in future periods, as final settlements are determined.  Contracts, laws and 
regulations governing the Medicare and Medi-Cal programs are complex and subject to 
interpretation.  As a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates may 
change by a material amount in the near term.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 
 

Net Patient Service Revenue (continued) 
The provision for doubtful accounts is based upon management’s assessment of expected net 
collections considering historical experience and other collection indicators.  Throughout the year, 
management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible accounts based upon 
historical write-off experience.  The results of this review are then used to make any modifications 
to the provision for doubtful accounts to establish an appropriate allowance for uncollectible 
accounts.     

 
Charity Care  
SHC provides either full or partial charity care to patients who meet certain criteria under its 
charity care policy without charge or at amounts less than its established rates.  Amounts 
determined to qualify as charity care are not reported as net patient service revenue.  SHC also 
provides services to other indigent patients under Medi-Cal and other publicly sponsored 
programs, which reimburse at amounts less than the cost of the services provided to the 
recipients.  The difference between the cost of services provided to these indigent persons and 
the expected reimbursement is included in the estimated cost of charity care. 
 
Premium Revenue 
UHA has capitated agreements with various health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”) to 
provide medical services to enrollees.  Under these agreements, monthly payments are received 
based on the number of health plan enrollees.  These receipts are recorded as premium revenue 
in the consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets.  Costs are accrued when 
services are rendered under these contracts, including cost estimates of incurred but not reported 
(“IBNR”) claims.  The IBNR accrual (which is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
in the consolidated balance sheets) includes an estimate of the costs of services for which UHA is 
responsible, including referrals to outside healthcare providers. 
 
Income Taxes  
SHC, UHA, SHC-VC and SHC Advantage are not-for-profit corporations and tax-exempt pursuant 
to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.  SBC LLC, SEROC, CareCounsel and SHI 
are limited liability companies and taxable income flows through to the individual members.  
SUMIT is currently exempt from all taxes until March 31, 2035.  TRA is a limited liability company, 
but has elected to be taxed as a corporation.  PEAC is a taxable corporation.  SHC and its 
subsidiaries have no uncertain tax positions pertaining to unrelated business income.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 
 

Self-Insurance Plans  
SHC and SHC-VC self-insure for professional liability risks, postretirement medical benefits, 
workers’ compensation and health and dental benefits.  These liabilities are reflected as self-
insurance reserves in the consolidated balance sheets.       
 
� Professional Liability — SHC and SHC-VC are self-insured through SUMIT for medical 

malpractice and general liability losses under claims-made coverage.  SHC and SHC-VC also 
maintain professional liability reserves for claims not covered by SUMIT which total $5,249 
and $817 as of August 31, 2017, respectively.  As of August 31, 2016, this coverage was 
$5,036 and $1,122 for SHC and SHC-VC, respectively.  Since September 1, 2005, SUMIT 
has retained 100% of the risk related to the first $15,000 per occurrence.  The next $165,000 
is transferred to various reinsurance companies.  Prior to September 1, 2005, SHC 
maintained various coverage limits. 

 
� Postretirement Medical Benefits — Liabilities for post-retirement medical claims for current 

and retired employees are actuarially determined. 
 

� Workers’ Compensation — SHC and SHC-VC purchase insurance for workers’ 
compensation claims with a $750 deductible per occurrence.  Workers’ compensation 
insurance provides statutory limits for the State of California.  An actuarial estimate of 
retained losses (or losses retained within the deductible) has been used to record a liability. 
 

� Health and Dental — Liabilities for health and dental claims for current employees are based 
on estimated costs. 

 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments  
Due to the short-term nature of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued 
liabilities, and accrued salaries and related benefits, their carrying value approximates their fair 
value.  The fair value of the amounts payable under third-party reimbursement contracts is not 
readily determinable.  The fair value of long-term debt is estimated based on quoted market 
prices for the bonds or similar financial instruments. 

 
Concentration of Credit Risk 
Financial instruments, which potentially subject SHC to concentrations of credit risk, consist 
principally of cash and cash equivalents, patient accounts receivable, and investments in 
University managed pools. 
 
SHC’s concentration of credit risk relating to patient accounts receivable is limited by the diversity 
and number of patients and payers.  Patient accounts receivable consist of amounts due from 
commercial insurance companies, governmental programs, private pay patients and other third-
party payers. 
 
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent 
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues 
and expenses during the reporting period.  The most significant estimates relate to patient 
accounts receivable allowances, amounts due to third party payers, retirement plan obligations, 
and self-insurance reserves.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

 
Reclassification 
Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2016 consolidated financial statements to 
conform to the 2017 presentation.  Such reclassifications had no effect on excess of revenues 
over expenses as previously reported.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 
 
Recent Pronouncements 
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 
is the sole source of authoritative non-governmental U.S. generally accepted accounting 
principles.   
 
Pension service costs - In March 2017, the FASB issued an ASC update which requires that an 
employer report the service cost component of pension costs in the same line item as employee 
compensation costs within operating income.  The other components of net benefit cost are 
required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component 
and outside a subtotal of income from operations, and will not be eligible for capitalization.  The 
guidance is effective for SHC during the fiscal year ending August 31, 2020.  SHC is currently 
evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements. 
 
Consolidation - In January 2017, the FASB issued an ASC update which reinstates the 
presumption that a not-for-profit (“NFP”) entity that is a general partner controls a limited 
partnership.  The amendments in this update also add guidance on when an NFP limited partner 
should consolidate a for-profit limited partnership.  The guidance is effective for SHC during the 
fiscal year ending August 31, 2018.  SHC is currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will 
have on the consolidated financial statements. 
 
Debt issuance costs - In April 2015, the FASB issued an ASC update which requires debt 
issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value 
of the associated debt liability, and amortization of those costs reported as interest expense.  This 
guidance is effective for SHC during the fiscal year ending August 31, 2017, and early adoption is 
permitted.  In August 2015, the FASB issued a supplemental ASU which allows an entity to 
present debt issuance costs related to a line of credit arrangement as an asset and subsequently 
amortize the costs ratably over the term of the line of credit arrangement.  The recognition and 
measurement guidance for debt issuance costs is not affected.  SHC has adopted the guidance 
on debt issuance costs in fiscal year 2017; however fiscal year 2016 amounts have not been 
reclassified. 
 
Revenue recognition - In May 2014, the FASB issued an ASC update to improve the 
consistency of revenue recognition practices across industries for economically similar 
transactions.  Subsequently, the FASB has issued several amendments and updates to the 
original standard.  The core principle is that an entity recognizes revenue for goods or services to 
customers in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in return.  In August 
2015, the FASB voted to defer the implementation of the new guidance.  The guidance is 
effective for SHC during the fiscal year ending August 31, 2019, and should be applied on a 
retrospective or modified retrospective basis.  SHC is currently evaluating the impact that this 
guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
 
Fair value - In May 2015, the FASB issued an ASC update which removes the requirement to 
categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using 
the net asset value per share practical expedient as well as limiting disclosure requirement to 
investments for which the entity has elected to measure the fair value using that practical 
expedient.  The guidance is effective for SHC during the fiscal year ending August 31, 2018, and 
should be applied on a retrospective basis for each period presented.  SHC is currently 
evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
 
Leases - In February 2016, the FASB issued an ASC update which requires lessees to recognize 
operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance 
sheet.  The guidance is effective for SHC during the fiscal year ending August 31, 2020, and 
should be applied on a retrospective basis.  SHC is currently evaluating the impact that this 
guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 
 
Recent Pronouncements (continued) 
Not-for-profit reporting - In August 2016, the FASB issued an ASC update which modifies 
current NFP reporting requirements.  The ASC update changes the way NFPs classify net assets 
and results in significant changes to financial reporting and disclosures for NFPs.  The guidance 
is effective for SHC during the fiscal year ending August 31, 2019, and should be applied on a 
retrospective basis.  SHC is currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on its 
consolidated financial statements. 
 
Statement of cash flows - In August 2016, the FASB issued an ASC update which 
intends to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of 
cash flows.  The guidance is effective for SHC during the fiscal year ending August 31, 2020, and 
should be applied on a retrospective basis.  SHC is currently evaluating the impact that this 
guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.

3. Net Patient Service Revenue 
 

SHC has agreements with third-party payers that provide for payments at amounts different from 
SHC’s established rates.  A summary of payment arrangements with major third-party payers 
follows: 
 
� Medicare — Inpatient acute care services rendered to Medicare program beneficiaries are 

paid at prospectively determined rates per discharge.  These rates vary according to a patient 
classification system that is based on clinical, diagnostic and other factors.  Medicare 
reimburses hospitals for covered outpatient services rendered to its beneficiaries by way of 
an outpatient prospective payment system based on ambulatory payment classifications.   
 
Inpatient non-acute services, certain outpatient services and medical education costs related 
to Medicare beneficiaries are paid based, in part, on a cost reimbursement methodology.  
SHC is reimbursed for cost reimbursable items at a tentative rate with final settlement of such 
items determined after submission of annual cost reports and audits thereof by the Medicare 
administrative contractor.  The estimated amounts due to or from the program are reviewed 
and adjusted annually based on the status of such audits and any subsequent appeals.  
Differences between final settlements and amounts accrued in previous years are reported 
as adjustments to net patient service revenue in the year examination is substantially 
completed.  SHC’s Medicare cost reports have been audited by the Medicare administrative 
contractor through August 31, 2008.  Professional services are reimbursed based on a fee 
schedule. 

 
� Medi-Cal — Inpatient services rendered to Medi-Cal program beneficiaries are reimbursed at 

a prospectively determined rate per discharge.  Outpatient services are reimbursed based 
upon prospectively determined fee schedules.  Professional services are reimbursed based 
on a fee schedule. 

 
� Managed Care Organizations — SHC has entered into agreements with numerous third-

party payers to provide patient care to beneficiaries under a variety of payment 
arrangements.  These include arrangements with: 

 
� Commercial insurance companies, including workers’ compensation plans, which 

reimburse SHC at negotiated charges. 
 

� Managed care contracts such as those with HMOs and PPOs, which reimburse SHC at 
contracted or per diem rates, which are usually less than full charges. 

 
� Counties in the State of California, which reimburse SHC for certain indigent patients 

covered under county contracts. 
 

� Uninsured — For uninsured patients that do not qualify for charity care, SHC recognizes 
revenue on the basis of its standard rates for services less an uninsured discount applied to 
the patient’s account that approximates the average discount for managed care payers.

3. Net Patient Service Revenue (Continued) 
 
Patient service revenue, net of contractual allowances (but before provision for doubtful 
accounts), by major payor for the years ended August 31 is as follows: 

 
2017 2016

Medicare 858,076$       755,658$       
Medi-Cal 93,699 106,728
Managed Care - Discounted Fee for Services 3,108,719 2,870,437
Self pay and other 206,191 239,248
Related party 44,845 47,214

Patient service revenue, net of contractual allowances 4,311,530$    4,019,285$    
Provision for doubtful accounts (77,004) (126,280)
Net patient service revenue 4,234,526$    3,893,005$    

 
 
SHC recognized net patient service revenue adjustments of $24,265 and $4,303 as a result of 
prior years favorable developments related to reimbursement for the years ended August 31, 
2017 and 2016, respectively. 

 
Amounts due from Blue Cross, Medicare, and Blue Shield as a percentage of net patient 
accounts receivable at August 31 are as follows: 

2017 2016
Blue Cross 21% 18%
Medicare 14% 12%
Blue Shield 11% 11%   
 
SHC does not believe significant credit risks exist with these payers.  

California Hospital Quality Assurance Fee Program 
The State of California enacted legislation in 2009 which established a Hospital Quality 
Assurance Fee (“HQAF”) Program and a Hospital Fee Program.  These programs imposed a 
provider fee on certain California general acute care hospitals that, combined with federal 
matching funds, would be used to provide supplemental payments to certain hospitals and 
support the State’s effort to maintain health care coverage for children.  The effective period of 
this Hospital Fee Program was April 1, 2009 through December 31, 2010.  The State received 
final approval of the rates from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) in 
December 2010.   
 
Subsequent legislation extended the HQAF and Hospital Fee programs from January 1, 2011 
through June 30, 2011, which was approved by CMS in December 2011.   
 
Additional legislation extended the HQAF and Hospital Fee programs for 30 months from July 1, 
2011 through December 31, 2013.  CMS approved the 30 month fee-for-service (“FFS”) Medi-Cal 
supplement in June 2012.  CMS approved 24 months and 6 months of the Medi-Cal Managed 
Care (“MMC”) supplement in June 2013 and November 2014, respectively.   
 
State legislation Senate Bill 239 further extended the HQAF and Hospital Fee programs for 
another 36 months from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2016.  In December 2014, CMS 
approved the 36 month FFS Medi-Cal supplement. As of August 31, 2017, CMS has approved 18 
months of the MMC non-expansion supplement, and 12 months of the MMC expansion 
supplement, which are additional funds in excess of the matching (non-expansion) funds.

3. Net Patient Service Revenue (Continued) 
 

California Hospital Quality Assurance Fee Program (continued) 
SHC recognized $45,616 and $55,195 in net patient service revenue under these programs and 
$41,594 and $45,809 in other expense for HQAF to the California Department of Health Care 
Services for the years ended August 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  SHC recorded $6,230 in 
deferred revenue as of August 31, 2017, pending CMS approval.  
 

4. Charity Care and Uncompensated Costs 
 

SHC engages in numerous community benefit programs and services.  These services include 
health research, education and training and other benefits for the larger communities that are 
excluded from the information below. 

 
Uncompensated charity care is provided to vulnerable populations.  Additionally, Medi-Cal and 
Medicare program reimbursements do not cover the estimated costs of services provided. 
 
Information related to SHC’s charity care for the years ended August 31 is as follows: 

 
2017 2016

Charity care at established rates 99,916$         85,246$         
Estimated cost of charity care, net 21,997$         19,365$          
 
The estimated cost of providing charity care is based on a calculation which applies a ratio of 
costs to charges to the gross uncompensated charges associated with providing care to charity 
patients.  The ratio of cost to charges is calculated based on SHC’s total expenses divided by 
gross patient service charges.  SHC received $663 and $799 during the years ended August 31, 
2017 and 2016, respectively, from contributions that were restricted for the care of indigent 
patients. 

 
Estimated cost of services in excess of reimbursement for the years ended August 31 is as 
follows: 
 

2017 2016

Charity care 21,997$         19,365$         
Medi-Cal 343,594 283,260
Medicare 629,967 585,728

Total 995,558$       888,353$        
 

5.        Contributions Receivable 
            

Contributions are recorded at the discounted net present value of the future cash flows, adjusted 
for the risk of donor default, using a discount rate of 2.11% for new receivables recorded in 2017 
and 1.44% for receivables recorded in 2016.

Less: current portion (13,668)            (10,525)            
Contributions receivable, net of current portion 76,340$           87,228$           

 
Contributions receivable at August 31 are to be utilized for the following purposes: 

 
2017 2016

Plant replacement and expansion 94,517$           102,142$         
Other patient and clinical services 5,652 7,169

Total 100,169$         109,311$         
 

There were no conditional pledges at August 31, 2017 and 2016.

6. Investments and Investments in University Managed Pools (Continued)  
 

The composition of investments in University managed pools at August 31 is as follows: 
 

2017 2016
Investments in University managed pools:

Merged Pool 1,280,875$ 1,310,047$ 
Expendable Funds Pool 6,318        6,442        

Total 1,287,193$ 1,316,489$ 

Fair Value

 
 
The Merged Pool (“MP”) is the primary investment pool in which funds are invested.  The MP is 
invested with the objective of maximizing long-term total return.  It is a unitized pool in which the 
fund holders purchase investments and withdraw funds based on a monthly share value.  The 
MP's investments at August 31, 2017 and 2016 consist of approximately 3% and 4% cash and 
cash equivalents, 7% and 6% fixed income, 27% and 27% public equity securities, 8% and 9% 
real estate, 9% and 9% natural resources, 20% and 20% absolute returns, and 26% and 25% 
private equity securities, respectively. 

 
7.  Fair Value Measurements 
 

Fair value is the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a 
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the 
principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability.   

 
The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in 
pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity.  In addition, the fair value of 
liabilities should include consideration of non-performance risk. 
 
Accounting guidance expands the disclosure requirements around fair value and establishes a 
fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs.  The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels 
based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market.  
Each fair value measurement is reported in one of the three levels which are determined by the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.

7.  Fair Value Measurements (Continued) 
 

These levels are: 
 
Level 1:  Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as 
of the measurement date.  Financial assets and liabilities in Level 1 include U.S. Treasury 
securities and listed equities. 

 
Level 2:  Pricing inputs are based on quoted market prices for similar instruments in 
active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets, and 
model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in 
the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full 
term of the assets or liabilities.  Financial assets and liabilities in this category generally 
include asset-backed securities, corporate bonds and loans, municipal bonds and interest 
rate swap instruments. 
 
Level 3:  Pricing inputs are generally unobservable for the assets or liabilities and include 
situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the investment.  The inputs into 
the determination of the fair value require management’s judgment or estimation of 
assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities.  The 
fair values are therefore determined using factors that involve considerable judgment and 
interpretations, including but not limited to private and public comparables, third party 
appraisals, discounted cash flow models, and fund manager estimates.   

 
The following table summarizes SHC’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring 
basis as of August 31, based on the inputs used to value them:

Property and equipment, net 2,869,346$    2,401,880$    
 

 
Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $154,686 and $136,442 for the years ending 
August 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and is included in the consolidated statements of 
operations and changes in net assets. 

 
Medical equipment acquired under capital leases totaled $9,294 and $8,104 as of August 31, 
2017 and 2016, respectively, and building improvements acquired under capital leases totaled 
$1,970 as of August 31, 2017 and 2016, and are included in property and equipment in the 
consolidated balance sheets.  Amortization expense under capital leases is included in 
depreciation expense in the consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets.  
Accumulated amortization was $8,608 and $7,741 as of August 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
 
Interest expense on debt issued for construction projects and income earned on the funds held 
pending use are capitalized until the projects are placed in service and depreciated over the 
estimated useful life of the asset.  Capitalized interest expense net of capitalized investment 
income was $25,815 and $24,190 for the years ended August 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.   
 
Certain land and building, with a carrying value of $9,729 at August 31, 2016 was used as 
collateral on notes payable (see Note 9).

Outstanding Principal

 
In June 2008, the California Health Facilities Financing Authority (“CHFFA”), on behalf of SHC, 
issued Variable Rate Demand Bonds (“VRDB’s”) in the aggregate principal amount of $428,500 
(the “2008 Bonds”) to refund its previously issued 2006 Bonds.  The 2008 Bonds were comprised 
of $260,300 of 2008 Series A VRDB’s that were issued as Series A-1, Series A-2, and Series A-
3; and $168,200 of 2008 Series B VRDB’s that were issued as Series B-1 and Series B-2.   
 
In June 2009, SHC remarketed the 2008 Series A-1 bonds in the aggregate principal amount of 
$70,500.  In June 2010, SHC converted the 2008 Series A-1 bonds from an annual put mode to a 
long-term fixed interest rate mode.  The remarketing of the 2008 Series A-1 bonds generated an 
original issue premium of approximately $140; that, pursuant to the requirements of the 
underlying documents, was used to reduce the principal amount of the bonds from $70,500 to 
$70,360. 
 
In June 2010, CHFFA, on behalf of SHC, issued fixed rate revenue bonds in the aggregate 
principal amount of $296,055 (the “2010 Bonds”).  The 2010 Bonds were comprised of $149,345 
of 2010 Series A bonds, proceeds of which were used to refund the 1998B bonds, and $146,710 
of 2010 Series B bonds, proceeds of which were used to refund the 2003 Series B, C and D 
bonds.  The issuance of the 2010 Series A and Series B bonds generated original issue 
premiums of $10,944 and $3,292, respectively.

9. Debt Obligations (Continued) 
 

In June 2011, SHC remarketed the 2008 Series A-2, A-3 and B-2 bonds in the aggregate 
principal amount of $272,365.  SHC converted the 2008 Series A-2 bonds from a weekly interest 
rate mode and the 2008 Series A-3 bonds from a multi-annual put mode to a long-term fixed 
interest rate mode.  The remarketing of the 2008 Series A-3 bonds generated an original issue 
premium of approximately $1,535; that, pursuant to the requirements of the underlying 
documents, was used to reduce the principal amount of the bonds from $85,700 to $84,165.  
SHC converted the 2008 Series B-2 bonds from a weekly interest rate mode to a commercial 
paper mode.  As a part of the conversion, the 2008 Series B-2 bonds were split into two sub-
series in the amount of $42,050 each.  Bonds in a commercial paper mode are remarketed for 
various periods that can be no longer than 270 days and are established at the beginning of each 
commercial paper rate period.  Bondholders in a commercial paper mode have the option to 
tender their bonds only at the end of the commercial paper rate period.   
 
In May 2012, CHFFA, on behalf of SHC, issued four series of revenue bonds in the aggregate 
principal amount of $568,320 (the “2012 Bonds”).  The 2012 Bonds were comprised of $340,000 
of 2012 Series A bonds, $68,320 of Series B bonds, $60,000 of Series C bonds and $100,000 of 
Series D bonds.  The issuance of the 2012 Series A and Series B bonds generated original issue 
premiums of $29,097 and $10,877, respectively.  Proceeds of the 2012 Series A, C and D bonds 
will be used to finance a portion of the New Stanford Hospital.  Proceeds of the 2012 Series B 
bonds were used to advance refund the 2003 Series A bonds.   
 
In June 2015, CHFFA, on behalf of SHC, issued two series of revenue bonds in the aggregate 
principal amount of $175,000 (the “2015 Bonds”).  The 2015 Bonds were comprised of $100,000 
of 2015 Series A bonds, and $75,000 of Series B bonds.  The 2015 Series A bonds generated an 
original issue premium of $5,627.  Proceeds of the 2015 Series A and B bonds will be used to 
finance a portion of the New Stanford Hospital.  
 
In May 2017, SHC entered into a $200,000 revolving credit facility.  Drawdowns from the 
revolving credit facility bear interest at a floating rate equal to the applicable London Interbank 
Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a specified margin.  The amount outstanding on this credit facility 
was $135,000 as of August 31, 2017. 
 
The 2008 Series B-1 bonds are in a weekly interest rate mode and are remarketed every 7 days 
at the then prevailing interest rate.  Bondholders in a weekly interest rate mode have the option of 
tendering their bonds on a weekly basis.  The 2012 Series C bonds are in a Windows weekly 
floating index mode and cannot be tendered for 180 days after a 30 day notice and remarketing 
period.  The 2008 Series B bonds and the 2012 Series C bonds are supported by SHC’s self-
liquidity and are classified as current liabilities.  The 2012 Series D and 2015 Series B bonds are 
also in a floating index mode with monthly interest rate resets and were directly placed with U.S. 
Bank.  The 2012 Series D and 2015 Series B bonds are not subject to remarketing or tender until 
May 13, 2020 and June 28, 2024, respectively.  Both series of bonds are classified as long-term 
liabilities.  

 
The 2015 Bonds, together with the 2012, 2010, and 2008 Bonds are collectively referred to as the 
“Revenue Bonds”.  The Revenue Bonds are limited obligations of CHFFA and are payable solely 
from payments made by SHC.  Payments of principal and interest on the Revenue Bonds are 
collateralized by a pledge against the revenues of SHC secured under a master trust indenture 
between SHC and the master trustee.  The master trust indenture includes, among other things, 
limitations on additional indebtedness, liens on property, restrictions on the disposition or transfer 
of assets, and maintenance of certain financial ratios.  SHC may redeem the Revenue Bonds, in 
whole or in part, prior to the stated maturities.  Total debt outstanding under the master trust 
indenture is in the aggregate principal amounts of $1,533,315 and $1,411,555 as of August 31, 
2017 and 2016, respectively.

The scheduled principal payments above represent the annual payments required under debt 
repayment schedules.  The current portion of long-term obligations, including debt subject to 
short term remarketing arrangements, includes payments scheduled to be made in 2018, pay 
down of the balance outstanding under the revolving line of credit, and the VRDB’s supported by 
SHC's liquidity.  The VRDB’s supported by self-liquidity provide the bondholder with an option to 
tender the bonds to SHC.  Generally accepted accounting principles require that bonds supported 
by SHC's liquidity be classified as current liabilities. 
 
In the event SHC receives notice of any optional tender of the 2008 Series B-1 bonds or the 2012 
Series C bonds, or if any bonds become subject to mandatory tender, the purchase price of the 
bonds will be paid from the remarketing of such bonds.  However, if the remarketing proceeds are 
insufficient, SHC will have a current obligation to purchase any remaining bonds.  SHC maintains 
sufficient liquidity to provide for the full and timely purchase price of any bonds tendered in the 
event of a failed remarketing. 
 
The estimated fair value of the Revenue Bonds as of August 31, 2017 and 2016 was $1,517,350 
and $1,585,366, respectively, and is considered level 2 based on the inputs used to value the 
Revenue Bonds as defined in Note 7. 
 
In 1998, SHC advance refunded its 1993 bonds in the amount of $89,520 by issuing the 1998 
Series B bonds.  As of August 31, 2017 and 2016, $12,095 and $17,490, respectively, of advance 
refunded bonds, which are considered extinguished, remain outstanding. 

 
Interest Rate Swap Agreements  
SHC entered into various interest rate swap agreements to manage fluctuations in cash flows 
resulting from variable rate debt interest risk.  Under the terms of the current agreements, SHC 
pays a fixed interest rate, determined at inception, and receives a variable rate on the underlying 
notional principal amount based on a percentage of the One Month LIBOR. 
 
SHC currently has nine outstanding interest rate exchange agreements that were originally 
entered into in 2003, 2006 and 2008 with maturities through November 2051.  Various 
agreements were amended and restated to forward interest rate swaps in 2010 and 2012.  The 
effective dates of these amended agreements became 2012 and 2016, respectively.  As a result, 
cash flows on these agreements did not commence until 2012 and 2016.

SHC designates its interest rate swaps that are used to minimize the variability in cash flows of 
interest-bearing liabilities or forecasted transactions caused by changes in interest rates as 
hedging instruments at the inception of each contract, with the intention of maintaining hedge 
accounting treatment over the term of the agreement.  However, circumstances may arise 
whereby the representations made at the inception of the agreement became invalid, or the 
structure of the bonds is changed, resulting in de-designation of the hedge.  In June 2008, the 
underlying bonds that were being hedged were refinanced and as a result, none of the swap 
agreements are treated as a hedge for accounting purposes.  
 
The fair value of interest rate swaps (all of which are designated as non-hedging instruments) is 
shown on the balance sheets as of August 31 as follows:

9. Debt Obligations (Continued) 
 

Interest Rate Swap Agreements (continued) 
SHC has two swap agreements which require mutual posting of collateral by SHC and the 
counterparties if the termination values exceed a predetermined threshold dollar amount.  There 
was $10,090 and $36,230 of cash collateral posted by SHC at August 31, 2017 and 2016, 
respectively. 
 
Upon the occurrence of certain events of default or termination events identified in the derivative 
contracts, either SHC or the counterparty could terminate the contracts in accordance with their 
terms.  Termination results in the payment of a termination amount by one party that attempts to 
compensate the other party for its economic losses.  If interest rates at the time of termination are 
lower than those specified in the derivatives contract, SHC will make a payment to the 
counterparty.  Conversely, if interest rates at such time are higher, the counterparty will make a 
payment to SHC. 

 
Bond Interest Expense 
The components of bond interest expense for the years ended August 31 are as follows: 
 

2017 2016

Interest and fees 25,976$  25,678$  
Swap settlements 17,195 13,497

Bond interest expense 43,171$  39,175$  

Interest capitalized as a cost of construction 25,815$  24,190$  
 
10. Retirement Plans 

 
SHC provides retirement benefits through defined benefit and defined contribution retirement 
plans covering substantially all benefit eligible employees. 
 
Defined Contribution Retirement Plan  
Employer contributions to the defined contribution retirement plan are based on a percentage of 
participant annual compensation.  Employer contributions to this plan for SHC employees, 
excluding LPCH employees (see Note 13), totaling $83,262 and $69,180, UHA employer 
contributions totaling $3,485 and $2,526, and SHC-VC employer contributions totaling $3,737 
and $7,479, for the years ended August 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, are included in salaries 
and benefits expense in the consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets.

10. Retirement Plans (Continued) 
 
Defined Benefit Pension Plan  
Certain employees of SHC are covered by a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan (the 
“Staff Pension Plan”).  Benefits are based on years of service and the employee’s compensation.  
Contributions to the plans are based on actuarially determined amounts sufficient to meet the 
benefits to be paid to plan participants.   
 
As of August 31, 2004, SHC assumed the pension liability of the LPCH employees.  SHC 
received $187 and $193 in cash for the years ending August 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, 
which represented the current year pension expense related to LPCH employees.  
 
The valuation of the Staff Pension Plan uses assumptions for future mortality improvements.  For 
the fiscal year ending August 31, 2017, these assumptions were updated to include four 
additional years of Social Security Administration data resulting in a small decrease to the benefit 
obligation. 
 
For the fiscal year ending August 31, 2017, the valuation of the Staff Pension Plan reflects 
updated demographic assumptions for retirement, withdrawal, and benefit commencement age 
for terminated vested participants.  These assumptions were developed from the results of the 
2017 experience study, which was based on census data for the Staff Pension Plan for the 2014 
through 2017 plan years, and slightly decreased the benefit obligation. 
 
During the fiscal year ending August 31, 2016, the Staff Pension Plan was amended to allow for a 
temporary lump sum window for deferred vested participants.  During the window, eligible 
participants were contacted and offered an opportunity to take the lump sum value of their 
benefit, resulting in $17,217 in lump sum paid from the plan.  This large lump sum payment 
triggered settlement accounting which required a $6,079 recognition of the plan’s deferred losses, 
and also reduced the projected benefit obligation and assets by $17,217. 
 
Postretirement Medical Benefit Plan  
SHC currently provides health insurance coverage for SHC employees upon retirement as early 
as age 55, with years of service as defined by specific criteria.  The health insurance coverage for 
retirees who are under age 65 is the same as that provided to active employees.  A Medicare 
supplement option is provided for retirees over age 65. 
 
During the fiscal year ending August 31, 2016, the demographic assumptions used in the 
valuation of the Postretirement Medical Benefit Plan were reviewed and updated, resulting in a 
$17,600 decrease in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation.  The decrease was 
primarily due to lower expectation of plan utilization in the future. 

  
The following tables present information on plan assets and obligations, costs, and actuarial 
assumptions for the Staff Pension Plan and the Postretirement Medical Benefit Plan for the years 
ended August 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
 
The tables for the Postretirement Medical Benefit Plan include SHC and LPCH employees.  The 
total postretirement medical benefit liability was $84,179 and $76,644 as of August 31, 2017 and 
2016, respectively.  SHC recorded a liability within self-insurance reserves in the consolidated 
balance sheets of $65,823 and $59,895 as of August 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which 
represents the liability for SHC employees excluding LPCH employees.

To develop the assumption for the expected rate of return on plan assets, SHC considered the 
historical and future expected returns.  An independent investment consulting firm provided SHC 
with an estimate of the future expected returns for each asset class based on SHC’s asset 
allocation targets.  The evaluation of the historical returns and the future expected returns 
resulted in the use of 6.00% as the assumption for the expected return on plan assets.   
 
To determine the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation as of August 31, 2017, a 6.75% 
annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care was assumed for calendar 
year 2017, declining gradually to 4.50% by 2038, and remaining at this rate thereafter. 

 
Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the 
post-retirement medical benefit plan.  Increasing the health care cost trend rate by 1% in each 
future year would increase the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation by $1,937 and the 
aggregate service and interest cost by $101.  Decreasing the health care cost trend rate by 1% in 
each future year would decrease the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation by $1,754 
and the aggregate service and interest cost by $91. 

 
Plan Assets 
SHC’s Staff Pension Plan weighted-average asset allocations as of the measurement date 
August 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, by asset category are as follows:

Plan Investments 
The investment objective of the Staff Pension Plan funds is to maximize the total rate of return 
(income and appreciation) within the limits of prudent risk taking and Section 404 of the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act.  The funds are diversified across asset classes to achieve an 
optimal balance between risk and return and between income and capital appreciation.  Many of 
the pension liabilities are long-term.  The investment horizon is also long-term; however, the 
investment plan also ensures adequate near-term liquidity to meet benefit payments.   
 
The allowable asset mix range and target asset allocations are: 
 
Asset Category Acceptable Range Target Allocation
Equity securities 36% to 60% 50%
Debt securities 20% to 80% 50%  
 
Appropriate investments include common, preferred and convertible equities of domestic and 
foreign companies, mutual and commingled trust funds, top tier commercial paper, certificates of 
deposit, and fixed income securities whose assets are rated investment grade or better.  

 
Financial futures and options on futures traded on exchanges are also permitted for hedging 
purposes.  Prohibited investments include commodities, unregistered securities and short sales. 
Derivative products may not be used to leverage a portfolio or to speculate.  All assets must have 
readily ascertainable market value and be easily marketable. 

 
Portfolios are expected to be well diversified with respect to industry and economic sectors.  
Equity investments in any one company shall be limited to the greater of 5% of the market value 
of the portfolio at time of purchase or twice the applicable benchmark weighting of the security.  
The investment manager shall not hold more than 15% of any company’s outstanding equity.

Plan Investments (continued) 
Fixed income investments may consist of U.S. government, U.S. government guaranteed, and 
U.S. government agency securities.  Corporate bond holdings must have an investment grade 
credit rating at the time of purchase and during the holding period.  No single issuer of fixed 
income or cash equivalent securities (with the exception of the U.S. Government and its 
Agencies) will account for more than 10% of the market value of the fixed income securities in a 
manager’s portfolio. 

 
Concentration of Risk  
SHC manages a variety of risks, including market, credit, and liquidity risks, across plan assets 
through investment managers.  Concentration of risk is defined as an undiversified exposure to 
one of the above–mentioned risks that increases the exposure of the loss of plan assets 
unnecessarily.  Risk is minimized by diversifying our exposure to such risks across a variety of 
instruments, markets, and counterparties.  As of August 31, 2017, SHC did not have 
concentrations of risk in any single entity, manager, counterparty, sector, industry or country. 

 
Expected Contributions 
SHC expects to make $34,800 to its Staff Pension Plan for both SHC and LPCH employees 
during the fiscal year ending August 31, 2018.  SHC expects to contribute $5,687 to its 
Postretirement Medical Benefit Plan for only SHC employees during the fiscal year ending August 
31, 2018.

Permanently Restricted Net Assets 
In 2009, California adopted a version of the Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds 
Act (“UPMIFA”).  SHC has interpreted UPMIFA as requiring the preservation of the original gift as 
of the gift date of donor-restricted endowment funds absent explicit donor stipulations to the 
contrary.  As a result of this interpretation, SHC classifies as permanently restricted net assets (a) 
the original value of gifts donated to the permanent endowment, (b) the original value of 
subsequent gifts to the permanent endowment, and (c) accumulations to the permanent 
endowment made in accordance with the direction of the applicable donor gift instrument at the 
time the accumulation is added to the fund.  The portion of the donor-restricted endowment fund 
that is not classified in permanently restricted net assets is classified as temporarily restricted net 
assets until those amounts are appropriated for expenditure in a manner consistent with the 
standard of prudence prescribed by UPMIFA.

Permanently Restricted Net Assets (continued) 
In accordance with UPMIFA, SHC considers the following factors in making a determination to 
appropriate or accumulate endowment funds: 
 

1. The duration and preservation of the fund. 
 
2. The purposes of SHC and the donor restricted endowment fund. 

 
3. General economic conditions. 

 
4. The possible effect of inflation and deflation. 

 
5. The expected total return from income and the appreciation of investments. 

 
6. Other resources of the organization.

12. Temporarily and Permanently Restricted Net Assets (Continued) 
 

Permanently Restricted Net Assets (continued) 
All of SHC’s endowment, totaling $20,711 and $18,617 at August 31, 2017 and 2016, 
respectively, are invested in the MP.  The funds are held in perpetuity and invested to generate 
income to support operating and strategic initiatives. 

 
Return Objectives and Risk Parameters  
The return objective for the endowment assets is to generate optimal total return while 
maintaining an appropriate level of risk established by the University. 

 
Strategies Employed for Achieving Investment Objectives 
SHC relies on a total return strategy in which investment returns are achieved through both 
capital appreciation (realized and unrealized gain) and current yield (interest and dividend) 
managed by the MP. 

13. Related-Party Transactions 

Transactions with the University and SoM 
SHC has various transactions with the University and the SoM.  SHC records expense 
transactions where direct and incremental economic benefits are received by SHC. 
 
Expenses paid to the University and the SoM are reported as operating expenses in the 
consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets and are management’s best 
estimates of SHC’s arms-length payments of such amounts for its market specific circumstances.  
To the extent that payments to the University and the SoM exceed an arms-length estimated 
amount relative to the benefits received by SHC, they are recorded as transfers to the University 
and the SoM in other changes in net assets. 
 
SHC purchases certain services from the University and the SoM.  Payment for these services is 
based on management’s best estimate of its market specific circumstances. 
 
Services provided by the SoM include physician services that benefit SHC, such as emergency 
room coverage, physicians providing medical direction to SHC, and physicians providing service 
to the clinical practice, which are covered by the Professional Services Agreement (“PSA”).  Such 
expenses are reflected as purchased services in the consolidated statements of operations and 
changes in net assets, and total $678,239 and $607,274 for the years ended August 31, 2017 
and 2016, respectively. 
 
Services provided by the University and other SoM non-physician services include 
telecommunications, transportation, utilities, and certain administrative services, such as legal 
and internal audit.  Total costs incurred by SHC were $99,616 and $104,044 for the years ended 
August 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and are reflected in various categories in the 
consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets.   

 
SHC paid service fees to the University in the amount of $2,211 for the years ended August 31, 
2017 and 2016.  The service fees represent costs for the utilization of infrastructure owned by the 
University such as road improvements, parking garages and generators and are reflected in the 
consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets as other expense.  Expected 
payments over the next 16 years total $19,437.  Annual service fees range from approximately 
$2,369 for the year ending August 31, 2018 to $690 for the year ending August 31, 2033.

13. Related-Party Transactions (Continued) 

Transactions with the University and SoM (continued) 
SHC also received payment for services provided to the University including primarily building 
maintenance, housekeeping, and security.  Costs incurred by SHC in providing these services 
are reflected in the respective categories in the consolidated statements of operations and 
changes in net assets.  Reimbursement from the University totaled $38,088 and $37,844 for the 
years ended August 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and is reflected in the consolidated 
statements of operations and changes in net assets as expense recoveries. 
 
In addition, SHC received certain grant monies for clinical trials from the University.  Grant 
revenue totaled $6,767 and $5,748 for the years ended August 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, 
and is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets as net 
patient service revenue and recoveries. 

 
During the year ended August 31, 2004, SHC paid $5,500 to the University.  The amount 
represented a prepayment of a 51 year lease for property owned by the University.  The short 
term portion of $108 is included in prepaid expenses and other in the consolidated balance 
sheets as of August 31, 2017 and 2016.  The remaining amount included in other assets in the 
consolidated balance sheets is $3,702 and $3,810 as of August 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
 
For the years ended August 31, 2017 and 2016, SHC transferred $69,071 and $57,821, 
respectively, to the University.  These funds are used by the University to support the academic 
mission of the SoM and its initiatives as well as the general support of the academic community 
and physical plant.  For the years ended August 31, 2017 and 2016, SHC also transferred $305 
and $31,123, respectively, to the University which represents excess consideration paid in the 
acquisition of the Stanford Blood Center.  Total transfers of $69,376 and $88,944 for the years 
ended August 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, are included in other changes in unrestricted net 
assets in the consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets.  
 
SHC also received equity transfers of $2,748 and $2,645 during the years ended August 31, 2017 
and 2016, respectively, which represented restricted gifts originally donated to the 
University.  These gifts were subsequently re-designated mostly for SHC patient care services 
and the New Stanford Hospital and are included in changes in temporarily restricted net assets in 
the consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets.  
 
Transactions with LPCH 
SHC and LPCH share certain departments, including facilities design and construction, materials 
management, managed care contracting, compliance and general services.  Shared service costs 
are included in the respective categories on the consolidated statements of operations and 
changes in net assets, and are allocated between SHC and LPCH based on negotiated rates.  
Reimbursement received from LPCH totaled $31,360 and $30,340 for the years ended 
August 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and is reflected in the consolidated statements of 
operations and changes in net assets as expense recoveries.  
 
SHC provides various services to LPCH.  These services include operating room, cardiac 
catheterization, interventional radiology, radiation oncology and laboratory.  The cost of these 
services is charged back to LPCH based on a percentage of charges intended to approximate 
cost or a cost per procedure.  Costs of these purchased services are reflected in the appropriate 
category in the consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets.  
Reimbursement of purchased services from LPCH totaled $44,845 and $47,214 for the years 
ended August 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and is reflected in the consolidated statements of 
operations and changes in net assets as net patient service revenue.

maintenance, IT and utilities.  Reimbursement of these services totaled $40,681 and $33,448 for 
the years ended August 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and is reflected in the consolidated 
statements of operations and changes in net assets as expense recoveries. 
 
During the year ended August 31, 2016, SHC transferred $3,300 to LPCH which represented a 
partial reimbursement of prior year transfers due to revised estimate on capital projects.    
 

14. Operating and Capital Leases 
  

SHC leases various equipment and facilities under non-cancelable lease agreements expiring at 
various dates.  Total rental expense (included in other expense in the consolidated statements of 
operations and changes in net assets) under these leases for the years ended August 31, 2017 
and 2016 was $97,667 and $89,951, respectively.

15. Commitments and Contingencies  
 

SHC is aware of certain asserted and unasserted legal claims.  While the outcome cannot be 
determined at this time, management is of the opinion that the liability, if any, from these actions 
will not have a material effect on SHC’s financial position. 

 
SHC has irrevocable standby letters of credit in the amount of $21,583, which are required as 
security for the workers’ compensation self-insurance arrangements and $2,130 to serve as a 
security deposit for certain construction projects being undertaken by SHC.  No amounts have 
been drawn on these letters of credit as of August 31, 2017.   
 
At August 31, 2017, SHC had contractual obligations of approximately $309,432 primarily related 
to the construction of the new hospital and other capital projects and approximately $342,918 to 
support SHC’s operations, such as maintenance, food services, valet services and other 
purchased services.  
 
Effective December 23, 2014, SHC entered into a five year agreement with a global technology 
services and outsourcing company, pursuant to which SHC will receive certain information 
technology services.  Under the terms of the agreement, SHC will be charged fixed fees for one-
time transition services, ongoing recurring and event-based fees for information technology 
services, and additional fees plus expenses for project work agreed upon pursuant to work 
orders.  SHC has the right to extend the agreement for up to two consecutive one-year 
periods.  SHC anticipates that it will spend approximately $36,000 over the initial term of the 
agreement.  SHC has certain rights to reduce the scope of services to be purchased and to 
terminate the agreement early for a termination fee.  The amount of the termination fee depends 
on when the right to terminate is exercised, what services are terminated, and changes monthly 
from $1,136 to terminate all services in the month ending September 30, 2017 and decreasing 
gradually to $459 for the month ending December 31, 2019. 
 
The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations of federal, state and local 
governments.  Compliance with these laws and regulations can be subject to future government 
review and interpretation, as well as to regulatory actions unknown or unasserted at this time.  
Government activity with respect to investigations and allegations concerning possible violations 
of regulations by healthcare providers could result in the imposition of significant fines and 
penalties, as well as significant repayments for patient services previously billed.  SHC is subject 
to similar regulatory reviews, and while such reviews may result in repayments and/or civil 
remedies that could have a material effect on SHC’s financial results of operations in a given 
period, management believes that such repayments and/or civil remedies would not have a 
material effect on SHC’s financial position. 

 
As with many medical centers across the country, information security and privacy is a growing 
risk area based on developments in the law and expanding mobile technology practices.  SHC 
has policies, procedures, and training in place to safeguard protected information, but select 
incidents have occurred in the past and may occur in the future involving potential or actual 
disclosure of such information (including, for example, certain identifiable information relating to 
patients or research participants).  In most cases, there has been no evidence of unauthorized 
access to, or use/disclosure of, such information, yet laws may require reporting to potentially 
affected individuals and federal and state governmental agencies.  Governmental agencies have 
the authority to investigate and request further information about an incident or safeguards, to cite 
SHC for a deficiency or regulatory violation, and/or require payment of fines, corrective action, or 
both.  California law also allows a private right to sue for a breach of medical information.  The 
cost of such possible consequences has not been material to date to SHC, and management 
does not believe that any future consequences of these incidents will be material to the 
consolidated financial statements. 

 
The percentage of SHC employees that are covered by collective bargaining arrangements is 
approximately 31%.  There are currently no expired agreements.

15. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)  
 

California's Hospital Seismic Safety Act requires licensed acute care functions to be conducted 
only in facilities that meet specified seismic safety standards.  Facilities classified by the State of 
California as non-compliant in the event of an earthquake must be retrofitted, replaced or 
removed from acute-care service by applicable deadlines in 2020 or 2030. 

 
The California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development has classified a substantial 
portion of Stanford Hospital as compliant with seismic safety structural standards until 2030 and 
beyond.  Certain patient care activities are located in existing buildings that are structurally 
compliant until 2030.  However, these facilities have utility system configurations that must be 
modified no later than January 1, 2020 in order to remain in use for acute patient care.  SHC is 
constructing a new hospital facility to address seismic safety requirements, which will also enable 
retrofit work of the existing hospital facility utility infrastructure.  

 
Amendments of the Hospital Seismic Safety Act, through Senate Bill (“SB”) 90 and SB 499, allow 
extensions to compliance timelines for hospitals that meet certain eligibility requirements.  SHC 
has received approval from the State to extend the compliance deadline through 2019 for all 
buildings subject to the requirement.  These extensions will allow sufficient time to construct the 
new hospital and mitigate the deficiencies of the existing facility. 
 
In June 2011, the Palo Alto City Council certified the Final Environmental Impact Report, land use 
changes, permits and a Development Agreement with SHC, LPCH and the University as part of a 
Renewal Project.  In July 2011, the Palo Alto City Council provided final approval for the Renewal 
Project at the second reading of the Development Agreement.  The Renewal Project will rebuild 
Stanford Hospital and expand LPCH to assure adequate capacity, meet State-mandated 
earthquake safety standards, and provide modern, technologically-advanced hospital facilities.  
The Renewal Project also includes replacement of outdated laboratory facilities at the SoM and 
remodeling of Hoover Pavilion.  SHC’s share of the estimated cost is approximately $2.1 billion.  
As of August 31, 2017, SHC has capitalized $1,520 million, inclusive of $124 million in capitalized 
interest, related to this project.   
  
Based on current estimated schedules, management projects that the Renewal Project 
construction will be complete in 2019.

Report of Independent Auditors 
    On Accompanying Consolidating Information 
 
 
 
To the Board of Directors 
Stanford Health Care 
 
 
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Stanford Health Care (“SHC”) as of August 31, 
2017 and for the year then ended and our report thereon appears on page one of this document. That 
audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken 
as a whole. The consolidating information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and 
relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the consolidated financial 
statements. The consolidating information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the 
audit of the consolidated financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and 
reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the 
consolidated financial statements or to the consolidated financial statements themselves and other 
additional procedures, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America. In our opinion, the consolidating information is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to 
the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole. The consolidating information is presented for 
purposes of additional analysis of the consolidated financial statements rather than to present the 
financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the individual companies and is not a required 
part of the consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the financial 
position, results of operations and changes in net assets and cash flows of the individual companies.

Corporation has been designated as the Obligated Group Representative pursuant to the provisions of the Master 
Indenture. 

Covenants 

Payment of Required Payments.  Each Obligated Group Member jointly and severally covenants, to pay 
or cause to be paid promptly, all Required Payments at the place, on the dates and in the manner provided in the Master 
Indenture, or in any Related Supplement or Obligation.  Each Obligated Group Member acknowledges that the time 
of such payment and performance is of the essence of the Obligations under the Master Indenture.  Each Obligated 
Group Member further covenants to faithfully observe and perform all of the conditions, covenants and requirements 
of the Master Indenture, any Related Supplement and any Obligation. 



 

 C-20 

Maintenance of Properties; Payment of Indebtedness.  Each Obligated Group Member covenants to:   

(a) maintain its Property, Plant and Equipment in accordance with all valid and applicable governmental 
laws, ordinances, approvals and regulations including, without limitation, such zoning, sanitary, pollution and safety 
ordinances and laws and such rules and regulations thereunder as may be binding upon it; provided, however, that no 
Obligated Group Member shall be required to comply with any law, ordinance, approval or regulation as long as it 
shall in good faith contest the validity thereof;  

(b) maintain and operate its Property, Plant and Equipment in reasonably good working condition, and 
from time to time make or cause to be made all needful and proper replacements, repairs and improvements so that 
the operations of such Obligated Group Member will not be materially impaired;  

(c) pay and discharge all applicable taxes, assessments, governmental charges of any kind whatsoever, 
water rates, meter charges and other utility charges which may be or have been assessed or which may have become 
Liens upon the Property, Plant and Equipment, and will make such payments or cause such payments to be made in 
due time to prevent any delinquency thereon or any forfeiture or sale of any part of the Property, Plant and Equipment, 
and, upon request, will furnish to the Master Trustee receipts for all such payments, or other evidences satisfactory to 
the Master Trustee; provided, however, that no Obligated Group Member shall be required to pay any tax, assessment, 
rate or charge as long as it shall in good faith contest the validity thereof as set out in the definition of Permitted Liens;  

(d) pay or otherwise satisfy and discharge all of its obligations and Indebtedness and all demands and 
claims against it as and when the same become due and payable, other than obligations, Indebtedness, demands or 
claims (exclusive of the Obligations issued and Outstanding under the Master Indenture) the validity, amount or 
collectibility of which is being contested in good faith;  

(e) at all times comply with all terms, covenants and provisions of any Liens at such time existing upon 
its Property or any part thereof or securing any of its Indebtedness noncompliance with which would have a material 
adverse effect on the operations of the Obligated Group or its Property;  

(f) use its best efforts to maintain (as long as it is in its best interests and will not materially adversely 
affect the interests of the Holders) all permits, licenses and other governmental approvals necessary for the operation 
of its Property; and  

(g) take no action or suffer any action to be taken by others which would result in the interest on any 
Related Bond issued as a tax exempt obligation becoming subject to federal income taxation. 

Nothing in the Master Indenture shall be construed to require an Obligated Group Member to maintain any 
permit, license or other governmental approval, or to continue to operate or maintain any Property, Plant or Equipment, 
if, in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Obligated Group Member, such permit, license, governmental approval 
or Property, Plant or Equipment is, or within the next succeeding 12 calendar months is reasonably expected to 
become, inadequate, obsolete, unsuitable, undesirable or unnecessary for the business of the Obligated Group and 
failure to maintain or operate such permit, license, governmental approval or Property, Plant or Equipment will not 
materially adversely impair the operation of the Obligated Group. 

Insurance 

(a) Each Obligated Group Member, respectively, covenants and agrees that it will keep the Property, 
Plant and Equipment and all of its operations adequately insured at all times and carry and maintain such insurance in 
amounts which are customarily carried, subject to customary deductibles and alternative risk management programs 
and self-insurance, and against such risks as are customarily insured against by other health care institutions in 
connection with the ownership and operation of health facilities of similar character and size in the State of California. 

(b) The Obligated Group Representative shall employ an Insurance Consultant at least once every two 
(2) years to review the insurance requirements (including alternative risk management programs and self-insurance) 
of the Members.  If the Insurance Consultant makes recommendations for a change in the insurance coverage required 



 

 C-21 

by the Master Indenture, the Obligated Group Members shall change such coverage in accordance with such 
recommendations, subject to a good faith determination of the Governing Body of the Obligated Group Representative 
that such recommendations, in whole or in part, are not in the best interests of the Obligated Group Members or that 
such coverage is not obtainable at commercially reasonable rates.  In lieu of maintaining insurance coverage which 
the Governing Body of the Obligated Group Representative deems necessary, the Obligated Group Members shall 
have the right to adopt alternative risk management programs which the Governing Body of the Obligated Group 
Representative determines to be reasonable and which shall not have a material adverse impact on reimbursement 
from third-party payers, including, without limitation, to self-insure in whole or in part individually or in connection 
with other institutions, to participate in programs of captive insurance companies, to participate with other health care 
institutions in mutual or other cooperative insurance or other risk management programs, to participate in state or 
federal insurance programs, to take advantage of state or federal laws now or hereafter in existence limiting medical 
and malpractice liability, or to establish or participate in other alternative risk management programs; all as may be 
approved, in writing, as reasonable and appropriate risk management by the Insurance Consultant. 

(c) The Obligated Group Members shall have the right, without giving rise to an Event of Default under 
the Master Indenture solely on such account, (1) to maintain insurance coverage below that required by the provisions 
of the Master Indenture described in subsection (a) above, if the Obligated Group Representative furnishes to the 
Master Trustee a certificate of the Insurance Consultant that the insurance so provided accords the greatest amount of 
coverage available for the risk being insured against at rates which in the judgment of the Insurance Consultant are 
reasonable in connection with reasonable and appropriate risk management, or (2) to adopt alternative risk 
management and self-insurance programs in accordance with the provisions of the Master Indenture described in 
subsection (b) above. 

Against Encumbrances.  Each Obligated Group Member, respectively, covenants and agrees that it will not 
create, assume or suffer to exist any Lien upon the Property of the Obligated Group, except for Permitted Liens.  Each 
Obligated Group Member, respectively, further covenants and agrees that if such a Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) 
is nonetheless created by someone other than an Obligated Group Member and is assumed by any Obligated Group 
Member, it will make or cause to be made effective a provision whereby all Obligations will be secured prior to any 
such Indebtedness or other obligation secured by such Lien. 

Limitations on Indebtedness.  Each Obligated Group Member covenants that it will not incur any 
Indebtedness except in accordance with the provisions of the Master Indenture described below: 

(a) Long-Term Indebtedness, if prior to the date of incurrence of the Long-Term Indebtedness there is 
delivered to the Master Trustee an Officer's Certificate to the effect that: 

(1) the Debt Service Coverage Ratio for the most recent Fiscal Year for which Financial 
Statements are available with respect to all Long-Term Indebtedness then Outstanding at the time of such 
certification and the additional Long-Term Indebtedness to be incurred, but excluding any Long-Term 
Indebtedness to be refunded with the proceeds of said additional Long-Term Indebtedness to be incurred, 
was not less than 1.2:1.0; 

(2) (i) the Debt Service Coverage Ratio for the most recent Fiscal Year for which Financial 
Statements are available was not less than 1.2:1.0 and (ii) the Debt Service Coverage Ratio for each of the 
two (2) Fiscal Years beginning with the Fiscal Year commencing after the estimated completion of the 
construction, acquisition or equipping of Property to be financed by such Indebtedness (or, if the proceeds of 
such Indebtedness are not to be used for the construction, acquisition or equipping of Property, each of the 
two (2) Fiscal Years beginning with the Fiscal Year commencing after the incurrence of such Indebtedness) 
with respect to all Long-Term Indebtedness projected to be Outstanding (including the additional Long-Term 
Indebtedness to be incurred, but excluding any Long-Term Indebtedness to be refunded with the proceeds of 
said additional Long-Term Indebtedness to be incurred), is projected by the Obligated Group Representative 
to be not less than 1.25:1.0.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Master Trustee receives a report of an 
Independent Consultant to the effect that Industry Restrictions prevent the Obligated Group Members from 
generating the required levels of Income Available for Debt Service sufficient to result in a Debt Service 
Coverage Ratio of not less than 1.25:1.0, the 1.25:1.0 ratio requirement described in this subsection shall be 
reduced to a ratio of not less than 1.0:1.0; or 



 

 C-22 

(3) any other Long-Term Indebtedness (including, without limitation, Commercial Paper 
Indebtedness, treating the amount of Commercial Paper Indebtedness being incurred or Outstanding, as the 
case may be, as the principal amount for purposes of any calculations made to demonstrate compliance with 
the provisions of the Master Indenture described under this caption) provided that the aggregate principal 
amount of such Long-Indebtedness, together with any other Long-Term Indebtedness incurred pursuant to 
the provisions of the Master Indenture described in this clause (3) and then Outstanding, does not, as of the 
date of incurrence, exceed 10% of Total Revenues. 

(b) Completion Indebtedness without limitation; 

(c) Short-Term Indebtedness provided that either (i) the provisions of the Master Indenture described 
in subsection (a) above are satisfied calculated as if such Short-Term Indebtedness was Long-Term Indebtedness or 
(ii) the provisions of the Master Indenture described below are satisfied, in either case, as evidenced by an Officer's 
Certificate delivered to the Master Trustee: 

(1) the total amount of such Short-Term Indebtedness shall not exceed 20% of Total Revenues; 
and 

(2) the total amount of such Short-Term Indebtedness and Indebtedness incurred pursuant to 
the provision of the Master Indenture described below in clause (g) then Outstanding shall not exceed 25% 
of Total Revenues; and 

(3) in every Fiscal Year, there shall be at least a consecutive 20 day period when the balances 
of such Short-Term Indebtedness is reduced to an amount which shall not exceed 5% of Total Revenues. 

(d) Nonrecourse Indebtedness without limitation. 

(e) Long-Term Indebtedness, if such Long-Term Indebtedness is issued or incurred to refund Long-
Term Indebtedness and if prior to issuance or incurrence thereof there is delivered to the Master Trustee a resolution 
of the Governing Body of the Obligated Group Representative determining that such refunding is in the best interests 
of the Obligated Group, which resolution shall also state the reasons for such determination. 

(f) Subordinated Indebtedness, without limitation. 

(g) Any other Indebtedness, provided that the aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness, 
together with the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness incurred pursuant to the provisions of the Master 
Indenture described in subsection (c) above, does not, as of the date of incurrence, exceed 25% of Total Revenues. 

(h) Reimbursement or other repayment obligations under reimbursement agreements or similar 
agreements relating to credit facilities and/or liquidity facilities which provide credit support and/or liquidity for 
Indebtedness. 

Gross Revenue Fund 

(a) Each Obligated Group Member agrees that, as long as any of the Obligations remain Outstanding, 
all of the Gross Revenues shall be deposited as soon as practicable upon receipt in one or more deposit accounts 
designated as the "Gross Revenue Fund" which the Obligated Group Representative established and agreed to maintain 
pursuant to the provisions of the Original Master Indenture, subject to the provisions of the Master Indenture described 
in subsection (b) below, at such financial institution or institutions as the Obligated Group Representative shall from 
time to time designate, in writing, for such purpose (each, a "Depository Bank" and in the Master Indenture collectively 
called the "Depository Bank") and which has entered into an Account Control Agreement with the Obligated Group 
Members and the Master Trustee.  As security for the payment of Required Payments and the performance by each 
Obligated Group Member of its other obligations under the Master Indenture, each Obligated Group Member pledges 
and assigns to the Master Trustee and grants to the Master Trustee a security interest in, all its right, title and interest, 
whether now owned or hereafter acquired, in and to all Collateral, including Gross Revenues and the Gross Revenue 



 

 C-23 

Fund.  Each of the Obligated Group Members has executed or shall execute an Account Control Agreement, has 
executed or shall execute and cause to be filed Uniform Commercial Code financing statements, and has executed or 
shall execute and deliver such other documents (including, but not limited to, amendments to such Uniform 
Commercial Code financing statements) as may be necessary in order to perfect or maintain the perfection of such 
security interest.  Each Obligated Group Member authorizes the Master Trustee to execute and file any financing 
statements and amendments thereto as may be required to perfect or to continue the perfection of the security interest 
in the Collateral, including, without limitation, financing statements that describe the collateral as being of an equal, 
greater or lesser scope, or with greater or lesser detail, than as set forth in the definition of Collateral.  Each Obligated 
Group Member covenants that it will not change its name or its type or jurisdiction of organization unless (i) it gives 
thirty (30) days' notice of such change to the Master Trustee and (ii) before such change occurs it takes all actions as 
are necessary or advisable to maintain and continue the first priority perfected security interest of the Master Trustee 
in the Collateral. 

(b) Gross Revenues and amounts in the Gross Revenue Fund may be used and withdrawn by each 
Obligated Group Member at any time for any lawful purpose, except as otherwise provided in the Master Indenture.  
In the event that any Obligated Group Member is delinquent for more than one (1) Business Day in the payment of 
any Required Payment, the Master Trustee shall notify the Obligated Group Representative of such delinquency, and, 
unless such Required Payment is paid within ten (10) days after receipt of such notice, the Master Trustee shall be 
entitled to deliver an Order (as such term is defined in the Account Control Agreement) to the Depository Bank.  Upon 
delivery of the Order with respect to the Gross Revenue Fund, exclusive control over the Gross Revenue Fund shall 
be exercised by the Master Trustee as provided in the Account Control Agreement.  All Gross Revenues shall continue 
to be deposited in the Gross Revenue Fund as provided pursuant to the provisions of the Master Indenture described 
in subsection (a) above and the Master Trustee shall continue to exercise exclusive control over the Gross Revenue 
Fund until the amounts on deposit in said Gross Revenue Fund are sufficient to pay in full (or have been used to pay 
in full) all Required Payments in default and until all other then-existing Events of Default known to the Master 
Trustee shall have been made good or cured to the satisfaction of the Master Trustee or provision deemed by the 
Master Trustee to be adequate shall have been made therefor.  During any period that the Gross Revenue Fund is 
subject to the exclusive control of the Master Trustee, the Master Trustee shall use and withdraw from time to time 
amounts in said fund, to make Required Payments as such payments become due (whether by maturity, prepayment, 
redemption, acceleration or otherwise), and, if such amounts shall not be sufficient to pay in full all such payments 
due on any date, then to the payment of debt service on Obligations, ratably, without any discrimination or preference, 
and to such other payments in the order which the Master Trustee, in its discretion, shall determine to be in the best 
interests of the Holders of the Obligations, without discrimination or preference.  During any period that the Gross 
Revenue Fund is subject to the exclusive control of the Master Trustee, no Obligated Group Member shall be entitled 
to use or withdraw any of the Gross Revenues unless (and then only to the extent that) the Master Trustee in its sole 
discretion so directs for the payment of current or past due operating expenses of such Obligated Group Member; 
provided, however, that Obligated Group Members may submit requests to the Master Trustee as to which expenses 
to pay and in which order.  Each Obligated Group Member agrees to execute and deliver all instruments as may be 
required to implement by the Master Indenture.  Each Obligated Group Member further agrees that a failure to comply 
with the terms of the Master Indenture shall cause irreparable harm to the Master Trustee from time to time of the 
Obligations, and shall entitle the Master Trustee, with or without notice to the Obligated Group Representative, to 
take immediate action to compel the specific performance of the obligations of each of the Obligated Group Members 
pursuant to the provisions of the Master Indenture described under this caption. 

(c) Upon receipt of Gross Revenues, each Obligated Group Member covenants and agrees:  (i) to 
deposit in all Gross Revenues in the Gross Revenue Fund and not in any other fund or account; (ii) that the Gross 
Revenue Fund will be held as a deposit at the Depository Bank; and (iii) that the Gross Revenue Fund will not be 
moved from the Depository Bank without the prior written consent of the Master Trustee, which consent shall not be 
unreasonably withheld. 

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Master Indenture, the Gross Revenue Fund may consist of any 
number of deposit accounts provided that each such deposit account shall be established at a Depository Bank which 
has entered into an Account Control Agreement with the Master Trustee and one or more Obligated Group Members. 



 

 C-24 

Debt Coverage 

(a) Each Obligated Group Member, respectively, further covenants and agrees to manage its operations 
such that Income Available for Debt Service for the Obligated Group calculated at the end of each Fiscal Year will be 
not less than 1.10 times Maximum Annual Debt Service. 

(b) Within 5 months after the end of each Fiscal Year, the Obligated Group Representative shall 
compute the Debt Service Coverage Ratio for the Obligated Group for such Fiscal Year and furnish to the Master 
Trustee, an Officer's Certificate setting forth the results of such computation.  The Obligated Group Representative 
covenants that if at the end of such Fiscal Year the Debt Service Coverage Ratio shall have been less than 1.1:1.0, it 
will promptly employ an Independent Consultant to make recommendations as to a revision of the rates, fees and 
charges of the Obligated Group or the methods of operation of the Obligated Group to increase the Debt Service 
Coverage Ratio to at least 1.1:1.0 for subsequent Fiscal Years (or, if in the opinion of the Independent Consultant, the 
attainment of such level is impracticable, to the highest practicable level).  Copies of the recommendations of the 
Independent Consultant shall be filed with the Master Trustee within ninety (90) days of the retention of the 
Independent Consultant.  Each Obligated Group Member shall, promptly upon its receipt of such recommendations, 
subject to applicable requirements or restrictions imposed by law and to a good faith determination by the Governing 
Body of the Obligated Group Representative that such recommendations are in the best interest of the Obligated 
Group, revise its rates, fees and charges or its methods of operation or collections and shall take such other action as 
shall be in conformity with such recommendations. 

If either (i) the Obligated Group complies in all material respects with the reasonable recommendations of 
the Independent Consultant with respect to their rates, fees, charges and methods of operation or collection or (ii) the 
Obligated Group Representative determines that such recommendations are not in the best interests of the Obligated 
Group (and accordingly will not be followed) as evidenced by an Officer's Certificate filed with the Master Trustee, 
the Obligated Group will be deemed to have complied with the covenants set forth in the Master Indenture for such 
Fiscal Year, notwithstanding that the Debt Service Coverage Ratio shall be less than 1.1:1.0; provided, however, that 
the Debt Service Coverage Ratio shall not be reduced to less than 1.0:1.0 for any Fiscal Year.  Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, the Obligated Group Members shall not be excused from taking any action or performing any duty required 
under the Master Indenture and no other Event of Default shall be waived by the operation of the provisions of the 
Master Indenture. 

(c) If a written report of an Independent Consultant is delivered to the Master Trustee stating that 
Industry Restrictions have made it impossible for the Debt Service Coverage Ratio of 1.1:1.0 to be met, then such 
ratio shall be reduced to 1.0:1.0. 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Obligated Group Member may permit the rendering of services 
or the use of its Property without charge or at reduced charges, at the discretion of the Governing Body of such 
Obligated Group Member, to the extent necessary for maintaining its tax-exempt status or the tax-exempt status of its 
Property, Plant and Equipment or its eligibility for grants, loans, subsidies or payments from governmental entities, 
or in compliance with any recommendation for free services that may be made by an Independent Consultant; 
provided, however, that the Debt Service Coverage Ratio shall not be reduced to a ratio of less than 1.0:1.0. 

Limitation on Disposition of Assets 

(a) Each Obligated Group Member covenants that it will not sell, lease or otherwise dispose of any part 
of its Property in any Fiscal Year (other than (i) such Property as is described in Exhibit D to the Master Indenture 
which may be disposed of by the Obligated Group solely upon the written consent of the Obligated Group 
Representative; (ii) in the ordinary course of business; or (iii) as part of a disposition of all or substantially all of its 
assets as permitted by the Master Indenture, with a Book Value in excess of 10% of the Book Value of the Property 
of the Obligated Group, unless prior to said disposition: 

(1) there shall have been delivered to the Master Trustee an Officer's Certificate to the effect 
that such Property is or shall become within the next two (2) Fiscal Years inadequate, obsolete, unsuitable, 
undesirable or unnecessary for the operation and functioning of the primary business of the Obligated Group 
Members; or 



 

 C-25 

(2) there shall have been delivered to the Master Trustee an Officer's Certificate to the effect 
that the Value of the Property so disposed of by the Obligated Group Members in any Fiscal Year pursuant 
to the provision described in the Master Indenture does not exceed 5% of the total Value of the Property of 
the Obligated Group; or 

(3) there shall have been delivered to the Master Trustee an Officer's Certificate to the effect 
that such Property is being transferred to a Person who is not an Obligated Group Member if such Person 
shall become a Member pursuant to the Master Indenture substantially simultaneously with such transfer; or 

(4) there shall have been delivered to the Master Trustee an Officer's Certificate to the effect 
that such Property is being transferred to another Person in connection with a sale/leaseback or 
lease/leaseback financing transaction relating to such Property; or 

(5) there shall have been delivered to the Master Trustee an Officer's Certificate to the effect 
that the disposition is for Fair Market Value and does not materially adversely affect the operations of the 
Obligated Group; or 

(6) there shall have been delivered to the Master Trustee an Officer's Certificate to the effect 
that the Transaction Test is satisfied. 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing shall prohibit any disposition of assets among Obligated 
Group Members nor shall prohibit the Obligated Group Members from:  (1) making loans, including, without 
limitation, employee relocation loans, physician recruitment loans or other credit/funding extensions, provided that 
such loans or other credit/funding extensions are in writing and the Master Trustee receives an Officer's Certificate to 
the effect that (x) such loans are in furtherance of the exempt purposes of the Obligated Group Members or (y) the 
Obligated Group Members reasonably expect such loans to be repaid and such loans bear interest at a reasonable rate 
of interest and on commercially reasonable terms; or (2) transferring restricted gifts for the Obligated Group Members 
to an Affiliated Corporation which has the purpose to receive and disburse such restricted gifts. 

Merger, Consolidation, Sale or Conveyance.  Each Obligated Group Member covenants that it will not 
merge or consolidate with any other Person that is not an Obligated Group Member or sell or convey all or substantially 
all of its assets to any Person that is not an Obligated Group Member (a "Merger Transaction") unless: 

(a) After giving effect to the Merger Transaction, (i) the successor or surviving entity (hereinafter, the 
"Surviving Entity") is an Obligated Group Member, or (ii) the Surviving Entity (x) shall be a corporation or other 
entity organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America or any state thereof, (y) shall become an 
Obligated Group Member pursuant to the Master Indenture and (z) pursuant to the Related Supplement required by 
the Master Indenture, shall expressly assume in writing the due and punctual payment of all Required Payments of the 
disappearing Obligated Group Member under the Indenture; 

(b) The Master Trustee receives an Officer's Certificate to the effect that the Transaction Test is satisfied 
in connection with the Merger Transaction; 

(c) So long as any Related Bonds that are tax-exempt obligations are Outstanding, the Master Trustee 
receives an Opinion of Bond Counsel to the effect that, under then existing law, the consummation of the Merger 
Transaction, in and of itself, would not result in the inclusion of interest on such Related Bonds in gross income for 
purposes of federal income taxation; 

(d) The Master Trustee receives an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that:  (i) all conditions in the Master 
Indenture relating to the Merger Transaction have been complied with and the Master Trustee is authorized to join in 
the execution of any instrument required to be executed and delivered; (ii) the Surviving Entity meets the conditions 
set forth in the Master Indenture and is liable on all Obligations then Outstanding; (iii) the Merger Transaction will 
not adversely affect the validity of any Obligations then Outstanding and such Obligations then Outstanding are 
enforceable against the Surviving Entity in accordance with their respective terms; and (iv) the Merger Transaction 



 

 C-26 

will not cause the Master Indenture or any Obligations to be subject to registration under federal or state securities 
laws or the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (or, that any such registration, if required, has occurred); and 

(e) The Surviving Entity shall be substituted for its predecessor in interest in all Obligations and 
agreements then in effect which affect or relate to any Obligation, and the Surviving Entity shall execute and deliver 
to the Master Trustee appropriate documents in order to effect the substitution. 

From and after the effective date of such substitution (as set forth in the above-mentioned documents), the 
Surviving Entity shall be treated as though it were an Obligated Group Member as of the date of the execution of the 
Master Indenture and shall thereafter have the right to participate in transactions under the Master Indenture relating 
to Obligations to the same extent as the other Obligated Group Members.  All Obligations issued under the Master 
Indenture on behalf of a Surviving Entity shall have the same legal rank and benefit under the Master Indenture as 
Obligations issued on behalf of any other Obligated Group Member. 

Preparation and Filing of Financial Statements, Certificates and Other Information 

(a) Each Obligated Group Member covenants that it will keep adequate records and books of accounts 
in which complete and correct entries shall be made (said books shall be subject to the inspection by the Master Trustee 
(which inspection the Master Trustee is not required to make) during regular business hours after reasonable notice 
and under reasonable circumstances). 

(b) The Obligated Group Representative covenants that it will furnish to the Master Trustee and any 
Related Bond Issuer that shall request the same in writing: 

(1) As soon as practicable, but in no event more than 5 months after the last day of each Fiscal 
Year, one or more financial statements which, in the aggregate, shall include the Obligated Group Members.  
Such financial statements: 

(A) may consist of (i) consolidated or combined financial results including one or 
more Members of the Obligated Group and one or more other Persons required to be consolidated 
or combined with such Member(s) of the Obligated Group under GAAP or (ii) special purpose 
financial statements including only Members of the Obligated Group; 

(B) shall be audited by an Accountant selected by the Obligated Group Representative 
and shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of special purpose financial 
statements, for required consolidations); 

(C) shall include a consolidated or combined balance sheet, statement of operations 
and changes in net assets; and 

(D) if financial statements delivered to the Master Trustee pursuant to the provisions 
of the Master Indenture described in this subsection include financial information with respect to 
any Person who is not an Obligated Group Member or an Immaterial Affiliate as provided pursuant 
to clause (3) below or do not include financial information with respect to all Obligated Group 
Members, then the financial statements shall contain a consolidating or combining schedule from 
which financial information solely relating to the Obligated Group Members and Immaterial 
Affiliates may be derived. 

(2) At the time of the delivery of financial statements complying with the provisions of the 
Master Indenture described under subsection (b) above (such financial statements being hereinafter referred 
to as the "Financial Statements"), a certificate of the chief financial officer of the Obligated Group 
Representative, stating that the Obligated Group Representative has made a review of the activities of the 
Obligated Group Members during the preceding Fiscal Year for the purpose of determining whether or not 
the Obligated Group Members have complied with all of the terms, provisions and conditions of the Master 
Indenture and that each Obligated Group Member has kept, observed, performed and fulfilled each and every 



 

 C-27 

covenant, provision and condition of the Master Indenture on its part to be performed and none of such 
Obligated Group Members is in default in the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants, 
provisions or conditions, or if any Obligated Group Member shall be in default, such certificate shall specify 
all such defaults and the nature thereof. 

(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the results of operation and financial position of Immaterial 
Affiliates need not be excluded from Financial Statements delivered to the Master Trustee pursuant to the 
provisions of the Master Indenture described under this caption, and such results of operation and financial 
position may be considered as if they were a portion of the results of operation and financial position of the 
Obligated Group Members for all purposes of the Master Indenture notwithstanding the inclusion of the 
results of operation and financial position of such Immaterial Affiliates. 

(c) The Master Trustee shall not be obligated to review, verify, or analyze any Financial Statements 
delivered to the Master Trustee under the Master Indenture, and shall only retain such Financial Statements as a 
repository for the Holders. 

Membership in Obligated Group.  Additional Obligated Group Members may be added to the Obligated 
Group from time to time, provided that prior to such addition the Master Trustee receives: 

(a) a copy of a resolution of the Governing Body of the proposed new Obligated Group Member which 
authorizes the execution and delivery of a Related Supplement and compliance with the terms of the Master Indenture; 

(b) a Related Supplement executed by the Obligated Group Representative, the new Obligated Group 
Member and the Master Trustee pursuant to which the proposed new Obligated Group Member (i) agrees to become 
an Obligated Group Member, (ii) agrees to be bound by the terms of the Master Indenture, the Related Supplements 
and the Obligations, and (iii) irrevocably appoints the Obligated Group Representative as its agent and attorney-in-
fact and grants to the Obligated Group Representative the requisite power and authority to execute Related 
Supplements authorizing the issuance of Obligations or Series of Obligations, to execute and deliver Obligations and 
to make payments on all Obligations; 

(c) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that:  (i) the proposed new Obligated Group Member has taken 
all necessary action to become an Obligated Group Member, and upon execution of the Related Supplement, such 
proposed new Obligated Group Member will be bound by the terms of the Master Indenture; (ii) the addition of such 
Obligated Group Member would not adversely affect the validity of any Obligation then Outstanding; and (iii) the 
addition of such Obligated Group Member will not cause the Master Indenture or any Obligations to be subject to 
registration under federal or state securities laws or the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (or, that any such 
registration, if required, has occurred); 

(d) an Officer's Certificate to the effect that immediately after the addition of the proposed new 
Obligated Group Member, the Transaction Test would be satisfied; and 

(e) so long as any Related Bonds that are tax-exempt obligations are Outstanding, an Opinion of Bond 
Counsel to the effect that the addition of the proposed new Obligated Group Member will not, in and of itself, result 
in the inclusion of interest on any Related Bonds in gross income for purposes of federal income taxation. 

Withdrawal from Obligated Group.  Any Obligated Group Member may withdraw from the Obligated 
Group and be released from further liability or obligation under the provisions of the Master Indenture, provided that 
prior to such withdrawal the Master Trustee receives: 

(a) the written consent of the Obligated Group Representative to the withdrawal of such Obligated 
Group Member; 

(b) an Officer's Certificate to the effect that immediately following the withdrawal of such Obligated 
Group Member, the Transaction Test would be satisfied; and 



 

 C-28 

(c) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that:  (i) the withdrawal of such Obligated Group Member would 
not adversely affect the validity of any Obligation then Outstanding; and (ii) the withdrawal of such Obligated Group 
Member will not cause the Master Indenture or any Obligations to be subject to registration under federal or state 
securities laws or the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (or, that any such registration, if required, has occurred). 

Upon compliance with the conditions contained in the provisions of the Master Indenture described under 
this caption, the Master Trustee shall execute any documents reasonably requested by the withdrawing Obligated 
Group Member to evidence the termination of such Obligated Group Member's obligations under the Master 
Indenture, under all Related Supplements and under all Obligations. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation may not withdraw from the Obligated Group unless prior to 
or concurrently with such withdrawal, the Corporation shall transfer all or substantially all of its assets to another 
Member of the Obligated Group. 

Defaults and Remedies 

Events of Default.  Each of the following events shall be an Event of Default under the Master Indenture: 

(a) Failure on the part of the Obligated Group Members to make due and punctual payment of the 
principal of, redemption premium, if any, interest on, or any other Required Payment on, any Obligation. 

(b) Any Obligated Group Member shall fail to observe or perform any other covenant or agreement 
under the Master Indenture (including covenants or agreements contained in any Related Supplement or Obligation) 
and shall not have cured such failure within sixty (60) days after the date on which written notice of such failure, 
requiring the failure to be remedied, shall have been given to the Obligated Group Representative by the Master 
Trustee or to the Obligated Group Representative and the Master Trustee by the Holders of 25% in aggregate principal 
amount of Outstanding Obligations; provided that if such failure can be remedied but not within such 60 day period, 
such failure shall not become an Event of Default for so long as the Obligated Group Representative shall diligently 
proceed to remedy the failure.   

The Corporation has proposed amendment of the percentage set forth in subsection (b) above from 
25% in aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Obligations to a majority in aggregate principal amount of 
Outstanding Obligations.  Upon securing the consent of the Holders of 100% in aggregate principal amount of 
Outstanding Obligations, such amendment will take effect.  By purchasing the Bonds, the purchasers and 
Beneficial Owners will be deemed to have consented to such amendment. 

(c) A court having jurisdiction shall enter a decree or order for relief in respect of any Obligated Group 
Member in an involuntary case under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, or 
appointing a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator (or similar official) of any Obligated Group 
Member or for any substantial part of the Property of any Obligated Group Member, or ordering the winding up or 
liquidation of its affairs, and such decree or order shall remain unstayed and in effect for a period of sixty (60) 
consecutive days. 

(d) Any Obligated Group Member shall commence a voluntary case under any applicable federal or 
state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, or shall consent to the entry of an order for relief in an involuntary 
case under any such law, or shall consent to the appointment of or taking possession by a receiver, liquidator, assignee, 
trustee, custodian, sequestrator (or similar official) of any Obligated Group Member or for any substantial part of its 
Property, or shall make any general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or shall fail generally to pay its debts as 
they become due or shall take any corporate action in furtherance of the foregoing. 

(e) An event of default shall exist under any Related Bond Indenture. 

The Obligated Group Representative agrees that, as soon as practicable, and in any event within ten (10) days 
after such event, the Obligated Group Representative shall notify the Master Trustee of any event which is an Event 



 

 C-29 

of Default under the Master Indenture which has occurred and is continuing, which notice shall state the nature of 
such event and the action which the Obligated Group Members propose to take with respect thereto. 

Acceleration; Annulment of Acceleration 

(a) Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default under the Master Indenture, 
the Master Trustee may, and, upon (i) the written request of the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal 
amount of Outstanding Obligations or of any Holder if an Event of Default under the Master Indenture has occurred 
or (ii) the acceleration of any Obligation pursuant to the terms of the Related Supplement under which such Obligation 
was issued, the Master Trustee shall, by notice to the Members, declare all Outstanding Obligations immediately due 
and payable, whereupon such Obligations shall become and be immediately due and payable, anything in the 
Obligations or in the Master Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding; provided, however, that if the terms of any 
Related Supplement give a Person the right to consent to acceleration of the Obligations issued pursuant to such 
Related Supplement, the Obligations issued pursuant to such Related Supplement may not be accelerated by the Master 
Trustee unless such consent is properly obtained pursuant to the terms of such Related Supplement.  In the event of 
acceleration, an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of all Outstanding Obligations, plus all interest 
accrued thereon and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, which accrues on such principal and interest to the 
date of payment, shall be due and payable on the Obligations.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Obligation shall be 
accelerated if the Event of Default is the result of the nonpayment of a Subordinate Financial Product Extraordinary 
Payment issued on or after the date of effectiveness of the Master Indenture. 

The Corporation has proposed amendment of the percentage set forth in subsection (a) above from 
25% in aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Obligations to a majority in aggregate principal amount of 
Outstanding Obligations.  Upon securing the consent of the Holders of 100% in aggregate principal amount of 
Outstanding Obligations, such amendment will take effect.  By purchasing the Bonds, the purchasers and 
Beneficial Owners will be deemed to have consented to such amendment. 

(b) At any time after the Obligations have been declared to be due and payable, and before the entry of 
a final judgment or decree in any proceeding instituted with respect to the Event of Default that resulted in the 
declaration of acceleration, the Master Trustee may annul such declaration and its consequences if: 

(1) the Obligated Group Members have paid (or caused to be paid or deposited with the Master 
Trustee moneys sufficient to pay) all payments then due on all Outstanding Obligations (other than payments 
then due only because of such declaration); 

(2) the Obligated Group Members have paid (or caused to be paid or deposited with the Master 
Trustee moneys sufficient to pay) all fees and expenses of the Master Trustee then due; 

(3) the Obligated Group Members have paid (or caused to be paid or deposited with the Master 
Trustee moneys sufficient to pay) all other amounts then payable by the Obligated Group under the Master 
Indenture; and 

(4) every Event of Default (other than a default in the payment of the principal or other 
payments of such Obligations then due only because of such declaration) has been remedied. 

No such annulment shall extend to or affect any subsequent Event of Default or impair any right with respect 
to any subsequent Event of Default. 

Additional Remedies and Enforcement of Remedies 

(a) Upon the occurrence and continuance of any Event of Default, the Master Trustee may, and upon 
the written request of the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Obligations (and 
upon indemnification of the Master Trustee to its satisfaction by the Obligated Group for any such request), shall, 
proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders under the Master Indenture by such proceedings 
as the Master Trustee may deem expedient, including but not limited to: 



 

 C-30 

(1) Enforcement of the right of the Holders to collect amounts due or becoming due under the 
Obligations; 

(2) Civil action upon all or any part of the Obligations; 

(3) Civil action to require any Person holding moneys, documents or other property pledged 
to secure payment of amounts due or to become due on the Obligations to account as if it were the trustee of 
an express trust for the Holders of Obligations; 

(4) Civil action to enjoin any acts which may be unlawful or in violation of the rights of the 
Holders of Obligations; and 

(5) Enforcement of any other right or remedy of the Holders conferred by law or by the Master 
Indenture. 

The Corporation has proposed amendment of the percentage set forth in subsection (a) above from 
25% in aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Obligations to a majority in aggregate principal amount of 
Outstanding Obligations.  Upon securing the consent of the Holders of 100% in aggregate principal amount of 
Outstanding Obligations, such amendment will take effect.  By purchasing the Bonds, the purchasers and 
Beneficial Owners will be deemed to have consented to such amendment. 

(b) Regardless of the occurrence of an Event of Default, if requested in writing by the Holders of not 
less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Obligations (and upon indemnification of the Master 
Trustee to its satisfaction for such request), the Master Trustee shall institute and maintain such proceedings as it may 
be advised shall be necessary or expedient (1) to prevent any impairment of the security under the Master Indenture 
by any acts which may be unlawful or in violation of the Master Indenture, or (2) to preserve or protect the interests 
of the Holders.  However, the Master Trustee shall not comply with any such request or institute and maintain any 
such proceeding that is in conflict with any applicable law or the provisions of the Master Indenture or (in the sole 
judgment of the Master Trustee) is unduly prejudicial to the interests of the Holders not making such request. 

Application of Moneys After Default.  During the continuance of an Event of Default, all moneys received 
by the Master Trustee pursuant to any right given or action taken under the provisions of the Master Indenture 
described under the caption "Default" (after payment of the costs of the proceedings resulting in the collection of such 
moneys and payment of all fees, expenses and other amounts owed to the Master Trustee) shall be applied as follows: 

(a) Unless all Outstanding Obligations have become or have been declared due and payable (or if any 
such declaration is annulled in accordance with the terms of the Master Indenture): 

First:  To the payment of all installments of interest then due on the Obligations (including (i) 
Financial Product Payments to the extent made pursuant to a Financial Products Agreement secured or 
evidenced by an Obligation and (ii) Parity Financial Product Extraordinary Payments), in the order of their 
due dates, and, if the amount available is not sufficient to pay in full all installments of interest, Financial 
Product Payments to the extent made pursuant to a Financial Products Agreement secured or evidenced by 
an Obligation, and Parity Financial Product Extraordinary Payments due on the same date, then to the 
payment thereof ratably, according to the amounts of interest, Financial Product Payments to the extent made 
pursuant to a Financial Products Agreement secured or evidenced by an Obligation, and Parity Financial 
Product Extraordinary Payments due on such date, without any discrimination or preference; 

Second:  To the payment of all installments of principal then due on the Obligations (whether at 
maturity or by call for redemption) and other unpaid Required Payments in the order of their due dates, and, 
if the amount available is not sufficient to pay in full all installments of principal due on the same date, then 
to the payment thereof ratably, according to the amounts of principal due on such date, without any 
discrimination or preference; 



 

 C-31 

Third:  To the payment of all Subordinate Financial Product Extraordinary Payments in the order of 
their due dates, and, if the amount available is not sufficient to pay in full all Subordinate Financial Product 
Extraordinary Payments due on the same date, then to the payment thereof ratably, according to the amounts 
of Subordinate Financial Product Extraordinary Payments due on such date, then to the payment thereof 
ratably, according to the amounts of Subordinate Financial Product Extraordinary Payments due on such 
date, without any discrimination or preference. 

(b) If all Outstanding Obligations have become or have been declared due and payable (and such 
declaration has not been annulled under the terms of the Master Indenture): 

First:  To the payment of the principal and interest and other Required Payments (including (i) 
Financial Product Payments to the extent made pursuant to a Financial Products Agreement secured or 
evidenced by an Obligation and (ii) Parity Financial Product Extraordinary Payments, but excluding 
Subordinate Financial Product Extraordinary Payments) then due and unpaid on the Obligations, and, if the 
amount available is not sufficient to pay in full the whole amount then due and unpaid, then to the payment 
thereof ratably, without preference or priority of principal over interest, of interest over principal, of any 
installment or payment over any other installment or payment or of any Obligation over any other Obligation, 
according to the amounts due respectively, without any discrimination or preference; and 

Second:  To the payment of all Subordinate Financial Product Extraordinary Payments in the order 
of their due dates, and, if the amount available is not sufficient to pay in full all Subordinate Financial Product 
Extraordinary Payments due on the same date, then to the payment thereof ratably, according to the amounts 
of Subordinate Financial Product Extraordinary Payments due on such date, without any discrimination or 
preference. 

Such moneys shall be applied at such times as the Master Trustee shall determine, having due regard for the 
amount of moneys available and the likelihood of additional moneys becoming available in the future.  Upon any date 
fixed by the Master Trustee for the application of such moneys to the payment of principal, interest on the amounts of 
principal to be paid on such date shall cease to accrue, provided such moneys are applied by the Master Trustee to the 
payment of such principal.  The Master Trustee shall give such notices as it may deem appropriate of the deposit with 
it of such moneys or of the fixing of such dates.  The Master Trustee shall not be required to make payment to the 
Holder of any unpaid Obligation until such Obligation is presented to the Master Trustee for appropriate endorsement 
of any partial payment or for cancellation if fully paid. 

Whenever all Obligations have been paid under the terms of the Master Indenture and all fees and expenses 
of the Master Trustee have been paid, any balance remaining shall be paid to the Person entitled to receive such 
balance.  If no other Person is entitled thereto, then the balance shall be paid to the Members of the Obligated Group 
or such Person as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct. 

Remedies Not Exclusive.  No remedy granted by the terms of the Master Indenture is intended to be 
exclusive of any other remedy.  Each remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given 
under the Master Indenture or existing at law or in equity. 

Remedies Vested in the Master Trustee.  All rights of action (including the right to file proof of claims) 
under the Master Indenture or under any of the Obligations may be enforced by the Master Trustee without the 
possession of any of the Obligations or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto.  Any proceeding 
instituted by the Master Trustee may be brought in its name as the Master Trustee without the necessity of joining any 
Holders as plaintiffs or defendants.  Subject to the provisions of the Master Indenture described above under the 
caption "Application of Moneys After Default," any recovery or judgment shall be for the equal benefit of the Holders 
of the Outstanding Obligations. 

Master Trustee to Represent Holders.  The Master Trustee is by the Master Indenture irrevocably 
appointed as trustee and attorney in fact for the Holders for the purpose of exercising on their behalf the rights and 
remedies available to the Holders under the provisions of the Master Indenture, the Obligations, any Related 
Supplement and applicable provisions of law, in each case subject to the provisions of the Master Indenture described 



 

 C-32 

below under the caption "Holders' Control of Proceedings."  The Holders, by taking and holding the Obligations, shall 
be conclusively deemed to have so appointed the Master Trustee. 

Holders' Control of Proceedings.  If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, notwithstanding 
anything in the Master Indenture to the contrary, the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of 
Outstanding Obligations shall have the right (upon the indemnification of the Master Trustee to its satisfaction) to 
direct the method and/or place of conducting any proceeding to be taken in connection with the enforcement of the 
terms of the Master Indenture.  Such direction must be in writing, signed by such Holders and delivered to the Master 
Trustee.   However, the Master Trustee shall not follow any such direction that is in conflict with any applicable law 
or the provisions of the Master Indenture or (in the sole judgment of the Master Trustee) is unduly prejudicial to the 
interests of the Holders not joining in such direction.  Nothing shall impair the right of the Master Trustee to take any 
other action authorized by the Master Indenture which it may deem proper and which is not inconsistent with such 
direction by Holders. 

Termination of Proceedings.  In case any proceeding instituted by the Master Trustee with respect to any 
Event of Default is discontinued or abandoned for any reason or is determined adversely to the Master Trustee or the 
Holders, then the Obligated Group Members, the Master Trustee and the Holders shall be restored to their former 
positions and rights under the Master Indenture.  All rights, remedies and powers of the Master Trustee and the Holders 
shall continue as if no such proceeding had been taken. 

Waiver of Event of Default 

(a) No delay or omission of the Master Trustee or of any Holder to exercise any right with respect to 
any Event of Default shall impair such right or shall be construed to be a waiver of or acquiescence to such Event of 
Default.  Every right and remedy given by the Master Indenture to the Master Trustee and the Holders may be 
exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient by them. 

(b) The Master Trustee may waive any Event of Default which in its opinion has been remedied before 
the entry of a final judgment or decree in any proceeding instituted by it under the provisions of the Master Indenture, 
or before the completion of the enforcement of any other remedy under the Master Indenture. 

(c) Upon the written request of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of 
Outstanding Obligations, the Master Trustee shall waive any Event of Default under the Master Indenture and its 
consequences; provided, however, that, except under the circumstances set forth in the Master Indenture, the failure 
to pay the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Obligation when due may not be waived without the written 
consent of the Holders of all Outstanding Obligations. 

(d) In case of any waiver by the Master Trustee of an Event of Default, the Obligated Group Members, 
the Master Trustee and the Holders shall be restored to their former positions and rights.  No waiver shall extend to, 
or impair any right with respect to, any other Event of Default. 

Appointment of Receiver.  Upon the occurrence and continuance of any Event of Default, the Master 
Trustee shall be entitled (a) without declaring the Obligations to be due and payable, (b) after declaring the Obligations 
to be due and payable, or (c) upon the commencement of any proceeding to enforce any right of the Master Trustee 
or the Holders, to the appointment of a receiver or receivers of any or all of the Property of the Obligated Group 
Members (without the necessity of notice to any Obligated Group Member or any other Person), with such powers as 
the court making such appointment shall confer.  Each Obligated Group Member consents, and will if requested by 
the Master Trustee, consent at the time of application by the Master Trustee for appointment of a receiver, to the 
appointment of such receiver and agrees that such receiver may be given the right, to the extent the right may lawfully 
be given, to take possession of, operate and deal with such Property and the revenues, profits and proceeds therefrom, 
with the same effect as the Obligated Group Member could, and to borrow money and issue evidences of indebtedness 
as such receiver. 

Remedies Subject to Provisions of Law.  All rights, remedies and powers provided by the Master Indenture 
may be exercised only to the extent that the exercise thereof does not violate any applicable provision of law.  All the 



 

 C-33 

provisions of the Master Indenture are intended to be subject to all applicable mandatory provisions of law that may 
be continuing and to be limited to the extent necessary so that they will not render any provision of the Master 
Indenture invalid or unenforceable under the provisions of any applicable law. 

Notice of Default.  Within ten (10) days after a Responsible Officer of the Master Trustee has actual 
knowledge or has received written notice of the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Master Trustee shall mail notice 
of such Event of Default to all Holders, unless such Event of Default has been cured before the giving of such notice, 
the term "Event of Default" for purposes of the provisions of the Master Indenture being described under this caption 
being limited to the events specified in the provisions of the Master Indenture described above under the caption 
"Events of Default" under subsection (a) through (f), not including any grace periods provided for in subsection (b), 
(c) and (d).  Except in the case of default in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any of 
the Obligations and the Events of Default specified in the Master Indenture, the Master Trustee shall be protected in 
withholding such notice if and so long as the Master Trustee in good faith determines that the withholding of such 
notice is in the best interest of the Holders. 

Supplements and Amendments 

Supplements Not Requiring Consent of Holders.  The Obligated Group Representative (acting for itself 
and as agent for each Obligated Group Member) and the Master Trustee may, without the consent of or notice to any 
of the Holders, enter into one or more Related Supplements for any of the following purposes: 

(a) To correct any ambiguity or formal defect or omission in the Master Indenture; 

(b) To correct or supplement any provision which may be inconsistent with any other provision or to 
make any other provision with respect to matters or questions arising under the Master Indenture, which, in either 
case, does not materially and adversely affect the interests of the Holders; 

(c) To grant or confer ratably upon all of the Holders any additional benefits, rights, remedies, powers 
or authority, including, without limitation, the addition of provisions providing for the creation of a credit group which 
credit group shall consist of all Obligated Group Members and Persons designated as affiliates of Obligated Group 
Members, or to add to the covenants of and restrictions on the Obligated Group Members; 

(d) To qualify the Master Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, or 
corresponding provisions of federal law from time to time in effect; 

(e) To create and provide for the issuance of an Obligation or Series of Obligations as permitted under 
the Master Indenture; 

(f) To obligate a successor to any Obligated Group Member as provided in the Master Indenture; 

(g) To add a new Obligated Group Member as provided in the Master Indenture; or 

(h) To make any other change which does not materially and adversely affect the interests of the 
Holders. 

Supplements Requiring Consent of Holders 

(a) Other than Related Supplements referred to in the provisions of the Master Indenture described 
above under the caption "Supplements Not Requiring Consent of Holders," and subject to the terms contained in the 
Master Indenture and described under this caption, the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal 
amount of the Outstanding Obligations shall have the right to consent to and approve the execution by the Obligated 
Group Representative (acting for itself and as agent for each Obligated Group Member) and the Master Trustee of 
such Related Supplements as shall be deemed necessary or desirable for the purpose of modifying, altering, amending, 
adding to or rescinding any of the terms contained in the Master Indenture; provided, however, with respect to any 
Obligation registered in the name of a Related Bond Trustee and securing a Related Series of Bonds, payment of the 



 

 C-34 

principal of and interest on which is insured or otherwise guaranteed by a municipal bond insurance policy or is 
secured by a letter of credit, the provider of such municipal bond insurance or letter of credit shall be deemed to be 
the Holder of such Obligation for purposes of consenting to and approving the execution of Related Supplements for 
purposes of the Master Indenture, except as otherwise provided in the applicable Related Supplement or Obligation; 
and provided, further, however, that nothing in the Master Indenture shall permit or be construed as permitting a 
Related Supplement which would:   

(i) extend the stated maturity of, or time for paying interest on, any Obligation or reduce the 
principal amount of or the redemption premium or rate of interest or change the method of calculating interest 
payable on, or reduce any other Required Payment on any Obligation without the consent of the Holder of 
such Obligation;  

(ii) modify, alter, amend, add to or rescind any of the terms or provisions contained in the 
Master Indenture so as to affect the right of the Holders of any Obligations in default as to payment to compel 
the Master Trustee to declare the principal of all Obligations to be due and payable, without the consent of 
the Holders of all Obligations then Outstanding; or  

(iii) reduce the aggregate principal amount of Obligations then Outstanding the consent of the 
Holders of which is required to authorize such Related Supplement, without the consent of the Holders of all 
Obligations then Outstanding. 

(b) The Master Trustee may execute a Related Supplement (in substantially the form delivered to it) 
without liability or responsibility to any Holder (whether or not such Holder has consented to the execution of such 
Related Supplement) if the Master Trustee receives:  (i) a Request of the Obligated Group Representative to enter into 
such Related Supplement; (ii) a certified copy of the resolution of the Governing Body of the Obligated Group 
Representative approving the execution of such Related Supplement; (iii) the proposed Related Supplement; and (iv) 
an instrument or instruments executed by the Holders of not less than the aggregate principal amount or number of 
Obligations specified in the provisions of the Master Indenture described in subsection (a) above for the Related 
Supplement in question which instrument or instruments shall refer to the proposed Related Supplement and shall 
specifically consent to and approve the execution thereof in substantially the form of the copy thereof as on file with 
the Master Trustee. 

(c) Any such consent shall be binding upon the Holder of the Obligation giving such consent and upon 
any subsequent Holder of such Obligation and of any Obligation issued in exchange therefor (whether or not such 
subsequent Holder thereof has notice thereof), unless such consent is revoked in writing by the Holder of such 
Obligation giving such consent or by a subsequent Holder thereof by filing with the Master Trustee, prior to the 
execution by the Master Trustee of such Related Supplement, such revocation and, if such Obligation or Obligations 
are transferable by delivery, proof that such Obligations are held by the signer of such revocation.  At any time after 
the Holders of the required principal amount or number of Obligations shall have filed their consents to the Related 
Supplement, the Master Trustee shall file a written statement to that effect with the Obligated Group Representative.  
Such written statement shall be conclusive evidence that such consents have been so filed. 

(d) If the Holders of the required principal amount or number of the Outstanding Obligations have 
consented to the execution of such Related Supplement, no Holder shall have any right to object to the execution 
thereof, to object to any of the terms and provisions contained therein or the operation thereof, to question the propriety 
of the execution thereof or to enjoin or restrain the Master Trustee or the Obligated Group Representative from 
executing such Related Supplement or from taking any action pursuant to the provisions thereof. 

Execution and Effect of Supplements 

(a) In executing any Related Supplement permitted by the Master Indenture, the Master Trustee shall 
be entitled to receive and to rely upon an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such Related Supplement 
is authorized or permitted by the Master Indenture.  The Master Trustee may (but shall not be obligated to) enter into 
any Related Supplement that materially and adversely affects the Master Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities. 



 

 C-35 

(b) Upon the execution and delivery of any Related Supplement in accordance with the provisions of 
the Master Indenture described under the caption "Supplements and Amendments," the provisions of the Master 
Indenture shall be deemed modified in accordance therewith.  Such Related Supplement shall form a part of the Master 
Indenture for all purposes and every Holder shall be bound thereby. 

(c) Any Obligation authenticated and delivered after the execution and delivery of any Related 
Supplement in accordance with the Master Indenture may, and, if required by the Obligated Group Representative or 
the Master Trustee shall, bear a notation in form approved by the Master Trustee as to any matter provided for in such 
Related Supplement.  If the Obligated Group Representative or the Master Trustee shall so determine, new Obligations 
so modified as to conform in the opinion of the Master Trustee and the Governing Body of the Obligated Group 
Representative to any such Related Supplement may be prepared and executed by the Obligated Group Representative 
and authenticated and delivered by the Master Trustee in exchange for and upon surrender of Obligations then 
Outstanding. 

Amendment of Related Supplements.  Any Related Supplement may provide that the provisions thereof 
may be amended without the consent of or notice to any of the Holders, or pursuant to such terms and conditions as 
may be specified in such Related Supplement.  If a Related Supplement does not contain provisions relating to the 
amendment thereof, the amendment of such Related Supplement shall by governed by the provisions of the Master 
Indenture described under the caption "Supplements and Amendments." 

Satisfaction and Discharge 

The Master Indenture shall cease to be of further effect if:  (i) all Obligations previously authenticated (other 
than any Obligations which have been mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen and which have been replaced or paid as 
provided in any Related Supplement) and not cancelled are delivered to the Master Trustee for cancellation; or (ii) all 
Obligations not previously cancelled or delivered to the Master Trustee for cancellation are paid; or (iii) a deposit is 
made in trust with the Master Trustee (or with one or more national banking associations or trust companies acceptable 
to the Master Trustee pursuant to an agreement between an Obligated Group Member and such national banking 
associations or trust companies in form acceptable to the Master Trustee) in cash or Government Obligations or both, 
sufficient to pay at maturity or upon redemption all Obligations not previously cancelled or delivered to the Master 
Trustee for cancellation, including principal and interest or other payments (including Financial Product Payments 
and Financial Product Extraordinary Payments) due or to become due to such date of maturity, redemption date or 
payment date, as the case may be; and all other sums payable under the Master Indenture by the Obligated Group 
Members are also paid. 

SUPPLEMENTAL MASTER INDENTURE FOR OBLIGATION NO. 39 

General 

Supplement No. 39 provides for the issuance of Obligation No. 39 and provides the terms and form thereof.  
Obligation No. 39 further secures the obligation of the Corporation arising under and pursuant to the Loan Agreement 
with respect to the Bonds. 

Payments on Obligation No. 39; Credits 

Principal of and interest on Obligation No. 39 are payable in any coin or currency of the United States of 
America that on the payment date is legal tender for the payment of public and private debts.  Except as provided 
pursuant to the provisions of Supplement No. 39 described in subsection (b) below with respect to credits and as 
described under the caption "Prepayment of Obligation No. 39" below regarding prepayment, payments on the 
principal of and interest on Obligation No. 39 shall be made at the times and in the amounts specified in Obligation 
No. 39 by the Corporation (i) depositing the same with or to the account of the Trustee at or prior to the opening of

and (ii) giving a notice to the Master Trustee and the Trustee of each payment of principal or interest on Obligation 
No. 39, specifying the amount paid, and identifying such payment as a payment on Obligation No. 39. 



 

 C-36 

The Corporation shall receive credit for payment on Obligation No. 39, in addition to any credits resulting 
from payment or prepayment from other sources, as follows: 

(i) On installments of interest on Obligation No. 39 in an amount equal to moneys deposited in the 
Interest Fund created under the Indenture, to the extent such amounts have not previously been credited against 
payments on Obligation No. 39; 

(ii) On installments of principal of Obligation No. 39 in an amount equal to moneys deposited in the 
Principal Fund created under the Indenture, to the extent such amounts have not previously been credited on Obligation 
No. 39; 

(iii) On installments of principal and interest, respectively, on Obligation No. 39 in an amount equal to 
the principal amount of Bonds for the payment or redemption of which sufficient amounts (as determined by the 
provisions of the Indenture described below under the caption "Indenture - Discharge of the Indenture") in cash or 
United States Government Obligations are on deposit as provided pursuant to the discharge provisions of  the 
Indenture, to the extent such amounts have not been previously credited against payments on Obligation No. 39, and 
the interest on such Bonds from and after the date fixed for payment at maturity or redemption thereof.  Such credits 
shall be made against the installments of principal of and interest on Obligation No. 39 that would have been used, 
but for such call for redemption, to pay principal of and interest on such Bonds when due at maturity or called for 
redemption; and 

(iv) On installments of principal and interest, respectively, on Obligation No. 39 in an amount equal to 
the principal amount of Bonds acquired by the Corporation and delivered to the Trustee for cancellation or purchased 
by the Trustee and cancelled, and the interest on such Bonds from and after the date interest thereon has been paid 
prior to cancellation.  Such credits shall be made against the installments of principal of and interest on Obligation 
No. 39 that would have been used, but for such cancellation, to pay principal of and interest on such Bonds when due 
and, with respect to Bonds called for mandatory redemption, against principal installments that would have been used 
to pay Bonds of the same maturity. 

Prepayment of Obligation No. 39 

So long as all amounts that have become due under Obligation No. 39 have been paid, the Corporation shall 
have the right, at any time and from time to time, to pay in advance and in any order of due dates all or part of the 
amounts to become due under Obligation No. 39.  Prepayments may be made by payments of cash or surrender of 
Bonds as described above under the caption "Payments on Obligation No. 39; Credits."  All such prepayments shall 
be deposited upon receipt in the Optional Redemption Account and, at the request of and as determined by the 
Corporation, credited against payments due under Obligation No. 39 or used for the redemption or purchase of 
Outstanding Bonds in the manner and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture and in the Loan 
Agreement.  Notwithstanding any such redemption or surrender of Bonds, as long as any Bond remains outstanding 
under the Indenture or any additional payments required to be made under Obligation No. 39 remain unpaid, the 
Corporation shall not be relieved of its obligations under the Master Indenture, including Supplement No. 39. 

Prepayments made under Supplement No. 39 shall be credited against amounts to become due on Obligation 
No. 39 as described above, under the caption "Payments on Obligation No. 39; Credits" and as provided pursuant to 
the provisions of the Loan Agreement. 

The Corporation may also prepay all of its indebtedness under Obligation No. 39 by providing for 
prepayment of the Bonds in accordance with the defeasance provisions of the Indenture. 

Registration, Number, Negotiability and Transfer of Obligations 

Except as described in the paragraph immediately following this paragraph, so long as any Bond remains 
outstanding, Obligation No. 39 shall consist of a single Obligation without coupons registered as to principal and 
interest in the name of the Trustee and no transfer of Obligation No. 39 shall be registered under the Master Indenture 
except for transfers to a successor Trustee. 



 

 C-37 

Upon the principal of all Obligations then Outstanding being declared immediately due and payable upon 
and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Obligation No. 39 may be transferred if and to the extent the 
Trustee requests that the restrictions described in the preceding paragraph on transfers be terminated. 

Right to Redeem 

Obligation No. 39 shall be subject to redemption, in whole or in part, prior to the maturity at the times and in 
the amounts applicable to redemption of the Bonds as specified in the Indenture; provided that in no event shall any 
portion of Obligation No. 39 be redeemed unless a corresponding amount of Bonds is also redeemed. 

INDENTURE 

The Indenture sets forth the terms of the Bonds, the nature and extent of the security for the Bonds, various 
rights of the Bondholders, the rights, duties and immunities of the Trustee and the rights and obligations of the 
Authority. 

Pledge and Assignment; Revenues 

Subject only to the provisions of the Indenture permitting the application thereof for the purposes and on the 
terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture, there are pledged to secure the payment of the principal of and interest 
on the Bonds in accordance with their terms and the provisions of the Indenture, all of the Revenues and any other 
amounts (including proceeds of the sale of the Bonds) held in any fund or account established pursuant to the Indenture 
(excluding moneys on deposit in the Rebate Fund).  Said pledge shall constitute a lien on and security interest in such 
assets and shall attach, be perfected and be valid and binding from and after delivery by the Trustee of the Bonds, 
without any physical delivery thereof or further act. 

Pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, the Authority transfers in trust, grants a security interest in and 
assigns to the Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders from time to time of the Bonds, all of the Revenues and other 
assets pledged as described in the immediately preceding paragraph and all of the right, title and interest of the 
Authority in the Loan Agreement (except for (i) the right to receive any Additional Payments or Administrative Fees 
and Expenses to the extent payable to the Authority, (ii) any rights of the Authority to be indemnified, held harmless 
and defended and rights to inspection and to receive notices, certificates and opinions, (iii) express rights to give 
approvals, consents or waivers, and (iv) the obligation of the Corporation to make deposits pursuant to the Tax 
Agreement and Obligation No. 39.  The Trustee shall be entitled to and shall collect and receive all of the Revenues, 
and any Revenues collected or received by the Authority shall be deemed to be held, and to have been collected or 
received, by the Authority as the agent of the Trustee and shall forthwith be paid by the Authority to the Trustee.  
Subject to its rights and protections under the Indenture, the Trustee shall also be entitled to take all steps, actions and 
proceedings reasonably necessary in its judgment to enforce all of the rights of the Authority (other than those rights 
retained by the Authority under the provisions of the Indenture described under this caption) and all of the obligations 
of the Corporation under the Loan Agreement and all of the obligations of the Members under Obligation No. 39.  All 
Revenues deposited with the Trustee shall be held, disbursed, allocated and applied by the Trustee only as provided 
in the Indenture. 

Establishment of Funds and Accounts 

The Indenture creates an Interest Fund, a Principal Fund, including the Sinking Accounts to be established 
therein, a Rebate Fund, and a Redemption Fund, including the Optional Redemption Account and the Special 
Redemption Account to be established therein.  All such funds and accounts shall be established, maintained and held 
in trust by the Trustee and applied in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Indenture. 

Funding and Application of the Interest Fund.  Moneys in the Interest Fund shall be held, disbursed, 
allocated and applied by the Trustee only as provided in the Indenture.  The Trustee shall deposit the following 
Revenues in the Interest Fund when and as such Revenues are received:  (1) the interest component of all Loan 
Repayments, including the interest component of all prepayments of Loan Repayments made pursuant to the 
provisions of the Loan Agreement; (2) the interest component of all payments made pursuant to Obligation No. 39; 



 

 C-38 

(3) all interest, profits and other income received from the investment of moneys in the Interest Fund; and (4) any 
other Revenues not required to be deposited in any other fund or account established pursuant to the Indenture.  All 
amounts in the Interest Fund shall be used and withdrawn by the Trustee solely for the purpose of paying the interest 
on the Bonds, as the same becomes due and payable (including accrued interest with respect to any Bonds, purchased 
or redeemed prior to maturity pursuant to the Indenture). 

Funding and Application of the Principal Fund.  Moneys in the Principal Fund shall be held, disbursed, 
allocated and applied by the Trustee only as provided in the Indenture.  The Trustee shall deposit the following 
Revenues in the Principal Fund when and as such Revenues are received:  (1) the principal component of all Loan 
Repayments, but excluding the principal component of all prepayments of Loan Repayments made pursuant to the 
provisions of the Loan Agreement, which shall be deposited in the Redemption Fund; (2) the principal component of 
all payments made pursuant to Obligation No. 39, but excluding the principal component of all prepayments of Loan 
Repayments made pursuant to Obligation No. 39, which shall be deposited in the Redemption Fund; and (3) all 
interest, profits and other income received from the investment of moneys in the Principal Fund.  All amounts in the 
Principal Fund shall be used and withdrawn by the Trustee solely for the purpose of paying the principal of the Bonds 
as the same becomes due and payable, except that all amounts in the Sinking Accounts shall be used and withdrawn 
by the Trustee solely to purchase, redeem or pay on their stated maturity dates the maturity of Bonds to which such 
Sinking Account relates as provided in the Indenture. 

The Trustee shall establish and maintain within the Principal Fund a separate Sinking Account for each 
maturity and interest rate of Term Bonds.  On each Mandatory Sinking Account Payment date, the Trustee shall apply 
the Mandatory Sinking Account Payment required on that date to the redemption (or payment at maturity, as the case 
may be) of Term Bonds of the interest rate and maturity for which such Sinking Account was established, upon the 
notice and in the manner provided in the Indenture, provided that, at any time prior to giving notice of such redemption, 
the Trustee may apply moneys in such Sinking Account to the purchase of Term Bonds of the interest rate and maturity 
for which such Sinking Account was established at public or private sale, as and when and at such prices (including 
brokerage and other charges, but excluding accrued interest, which is payable from the Interest Fund) as directed in 
writing by the Corporation, except that the purchase price (excluding accrued interest) shall not exceed the par value 
of such Bonds.  If, during the twelve-month period immediately preceding said Mandatory Sinking Account Payment 
date, the Trustee has purchased Term Bonds of such interest rate and maturity with moneys in such Sinking Account, 
or, during said period and prior to giving said notice of redemption, the Corporation has deposited Term Bonds of 
such interest rate and maturity with the Trustee (together with a Request of the Corporation to apply such Bonds so 
deposited to the Mandatory Sinking Account Payment due on said date with respect to Term Bonds of such interest 
rate and maturity), or Term Bonds of such interest rate and maturity were at any time purchased or redeemed by the 
Trustee from the Redemption Fund and allocable to said Mandatory Sinking Account Payment, such Bonds so 
purchased or deposited or redeemed shall be applied, to the extent of the full principal amount thereof, to reduce said 
Mandatory Sinking Account Payment.  All Bonds purchased or deposited pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, 
if any, shall be cancelled and destroyed.  Any amounts remaining in a Sinking Account when all of the Term Bonds 
for which such account was established are no longer Outstanding shall be withdrawn by the Trustee and transferred 
to the Principal Fund.  Bonds purchased from a Sinking Account, purchased or redeemed from the Redemption Fund, 
or deposited by the Corporation with the Trustee shall be allocated first to the next succeeding Mandatory Sinking 
Account Payment for Term Bonds of such interest rate and maturity, then as a credit against such future Mandatory 
Sinking Account Payments for Term Bonds of such interest rate and maturity as the Corporation may specify in writing 
to the Trustee. 

Funding and Application of the Redemption Fund.  Moneys in the Redemption Fund shall be held, 
disbursed, allocated and applied by the Trustee only as provided in the Indenture.  The Trustee shall establish and 
maintain within the Redemption Fund a separate Optional Redemption Account and a separate Special Redemption 
Account.  The Trustee shall deposit the following Revenues in the Optional Redemption Account when and as such 
Revenues are received:  (1) except as provided in the provisions of the Indenture described in the following paragraph, 
the principal component of all prepayments of Loan Repayments made pursuant to the provisions of the Loan 
Agreement; (2) except as provided in the provisions of the Indenture described in the following paragraph, the 
principal component of all prepayments made pursuant to Obligation No. 39; and (3) all interest, profits and other 
income received from the investment of moneys in the Optional Redemption Account. 



 

 C-39 

The Trustee shall deposit the following Revenues in the Special Redemption Account when and as such 
Revenues are received:  (1) the principal component of all prepayments of Loan Repayments made pursuant to the 
provisions of the Loan Agreement which are specified in a Certificate of the Corporation to have been derived from 
insurance or condemnation proceeds received with respect to the health care facilities of the Corporation or proceeds 
of a sale, lease or other disposition of all or a portion of the facilities refinanced by the proceeds of the Bonds; (2) the 
principal component of all prepayments made pursuant to Obligation No. 39 which are specified in a Certificate of 
the Corporation to have been derived from insurance or condemnation proceeds received with respect to the health 
care facilities of the Corporation or proceeds of a sale, lease or other disposition of all or a portion of the facilities 
refinanced by the proceeds of the Bonds; and (3) all interest, profits and other income received from the investment 
of moneys in the Special Redemption Account. 

All amounts deposited in the Optional Redemption Account and in the Special Redemption Account shall be 
used and withdrawn by the Trustee solely for the purpose of redeeming Bonds, in the manner and upon the terms and 
conditions specified in the Indenture, at the next succeeding date of redemption for which notice has not been given 
and at the Redemption Prices then applicable to redemptions from the Optional Redemption Account and the Special 
Redemption Account, respectively; provided that, at any time prior to the selection of Bonds, for such redemption, the 
Trustee shall, upon written direction of the Corporation, apply such amounts to the purchase of Bonds, at public or 
private sale, as and when and at such prices (including brokerage and other charges, but excluding accrued interest, 
which is payable from the Interest Fund) as the Corporation may direct in writing, except that the purchase price 
(exclusive of accrued interest) may not exceed the Redemption Price then applicable to such Bonds (or, if such Bonds, 
are not then subject to redemption, the par value of such Bonds); and provided further that in the case of the Optional 
Redemption Account in lieu of redemption at such next succeeding date of redemption, or in combination therewith, 
amounts in such Optional Redemption Account may be transferred to the Principal Fund and credited against Loan 
Repayments in order of their due date as set forth in a Request of the Corporation.  All Bonds purchased or redeemed 
from the Redemption Fund shall be allocated to the Mandatory Sinking Account Payments specified by the 
Corporation in a Request of the Corporation delivered to the Trustee (or if the Corporation fails to deliver such 
Request, in inverse order of their payment dates). 

Funds provided for prepayment pursuant to the provisions of the Loan Agreement may also be deposited in 
an escrow fund or account to be held by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of the Loan Agreement. 

Funding and Application of the Rebate Fund.  The Trustee shall establish and maintain, when required, a 
fund separate from any other fund established and maintained under the Indenture designated as the Rebate Fund.  
Within the Rebate Fund, the Trustee shall maintain such accounts as the Trustee shall be instructed to maintain in 
writing by the Corporation, if the Corporation determines that such accounts are necessary in order to comply with 
the Tax Agreement.  Subject to the transfer provisions provided in the Indenture, all money at any time deposited in 
the Rebate Fund shall be held by the Trustee in trust, to the extent required to satisfy the Rebate Requirement (as 
described in the Tax Agreement), for payment to the federal government of the United States of America.  Neither the 
Authority, the Corporation, nor the Holder of any Bonds, shall have any rights in or claim to such money.  All amounts 
deposited into or on deposit in the Rebate Fund shall be governed by the provisions of the Indenture and by the Tax 
Agreement.  The Trustee shall be deemed conclusively to have complied with such provisions if it follows the 
directions of the Corporation and shall have no liability or responsibility to enforce compliance by the Corporation or 
the Authority with the terms of the Tax Agreement. 

Investment of Moneys in Funds and Accounts 

Subject to the limitations set forth in the Indenture, all moneys in any of the funds and accounts established 
pursuant to the Indenture shall be invested by the Trustee solely at the written direction of the Corporation and solely 
in Investment Securities.  Investment Securities shall be purchased at such prices as the Corporation may direct.  All 
Investment Securities shall be acquired subject to the limitations as to maturities and other matters as are set forth in 
the Indenture and such additional limitations or requirements consistent with the foregoing as may be established by 
Request of the Corporation.  In the absence of any other written direction from the Corporation, the Trustee shall 
invest solely in Investment Securities specified in clause (6) of the definition thereof; provided, however, that any 
such investment shall be made by the Trustee only if, prior to the date on which such investment is to be made, the 
Trustee shall have received a written direction from the Corporation specifying a specific money market fund and, if 
no such written direction from the Corporation is so received, the Trustee shall hold such moneys uninvested.  Unless 



 

 C-40 

otherwise specifically provided in the Indenture, ratings and credit criteria specified with respect to any Investment 
Security shall refer to the ratings assigned and the credit of the issuing or guaranteeing organization at the time such 
Investment Security is acquired.  Moneys in all other funds and accounts shall be invested in Investment Securities 
maturing not later than the date on which it is estimated that such moneys will be required for the purposes specified 
in the Indenture.  Investment Securities purchased under a repurchase agreement may be deemed to mature on the date 
or dates on which the Trustee may deliver such Investment Securities for repurchase under such agreement. 

All interest, profits and other income received from the investment of moneys in the Rebate Fund shall be 
deposited when received in such fund.  Unless otherwise specifically provided in the Indenture, all interest, profits 
and other income received from the investment of moneys in any other fund or account established pursuant to the 
Indenture shall be deposited when received in such fund or account.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the 
Indenture to the contrary, an amount of interest received with respect to any Investment Security equal to the amount 
of accrued interest, if any, paid as part of the purchase price of such Investment Security shall be credited to the fund 
or account for the credit of which such Investment Security was acquired. 

Investment Securities acquired as an investment of moneys in any fund or account established under the 
Indenture shall be credited to such fund or account.  Subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Trustee may 
commingle any of the funds or accounts established pursuant to the Indenture (other than the Rebate Fund) into a 
separate fund or funds for investment purposes only, provided that all funds or accounts held by the Trustee under the 
Indenture shall be accounted for separately as required by the Indenture.  The Trustee or its affiliates may act as 
principal or agent in the making or disposing of any investment and may also act as sponsor, advisor or manager in 
connection with any investments.  The Trustee may sell or present for prepayment or redemption, any Investment 
Securities so purchased whenever it shall be necessary to provide moneys to meet any required payment, transfer, 
withdrawal or disbursement from the fund or account to which such Investment Security is credited, and, subject to 
the provisions of the Indenture, the Trustee shall not be liable or responsible for any loss resulting from any investment 
made in accordance with provisions of the Indenture.  The Trustee shall not be responsible for any tax, fee or other 
charge in connection with any investment, reinvestment or the liquidation thereof. 

Certain Covenants 

Tax Covenant.  The Authority shall at all times do and perform all acts and things permitted by law and the 
Indenture which are necessary or desirable in order to assure that interest paid on the Bonds (or any of them) will be 
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and shall take no action that would result in such interest 
not being so excluded.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Authority agrees to comply with the 
provisions of the Tax Agreement.  This covenant shall survive payment in full or defeasance of the Bonds. 

Enforcement of Loan Agreement and Obligation No. 39.  The Trustee shall promptly collect all amounts 
due from the Corporation pursuant to the Loan Agreement and from the Members pursuant to Obligation No. 39, shall 
perform all duties imposed upon it pursuant to the Loan Agreement and, subject to its rights and protections under the 
Indenture, shall be entitled to enforce, and take all steps, actions and proceedings reasonably necessary for the 
enforcement of all of the rights of the Authority except such rights as the Authority shall have retained, including 
without limitation, the rights to enforce remedies upon the occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default, and 
all of the obligations of the Corporation and the other Members. 

Amendment of Loan Agreement.  Except as provided pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture described 
in the following paragraph, the Authority shall not amend, modify or terminate any of the terms of the Loan Agreement 
or consent to any such amendment, modification or termination without filing with the Trustee the written consent of 
the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds then Outstanding, provided that no such 
amendment or modification shall reduce the amount of Loan Repayments to be made to the Authority or the Trustee 
by the Corporation pursuant to the Loan Agreement, or extend the time for making such payments, without the written 
consent of the Holders of the Bonds then Outstanding. 

Notwithstanding the provisions of the Indenture described in the preceding paragraph, the Loan Agreement 
may be amended or modified from time to time and at any time by the Authority and the Corporation by a supplement 
to the Loan Agreement, which the Authority and the Corporation may enter into without the consent of any Holders, 
but only to the extent permitted by law and only for any one or more of the following purposes:  (i) to add to the 



 

 C-41 

covenants and agreements of the Authority or the Corporation contained in the Loan Agreement other covenants and 
agreements thereafter to be observed, to pledge or assign additional security for the Bonds (or any portion thereof), or 
to surrender any right or power therein reserved to or conferred upon the Authority or the Corporation, provided, that 
no such covenant, agreement, pledge, assignment or surrender shall materially adversely affect the interests of the 
Holders of the Bonds; (ii) to make such provisions for the purpose of curing any ambiguity, inconsistency or omission, 
or of curing or correcting any defective provision, contained in the Loan Agreement, or in regard to matters or 
questions arising under the Loan Agreement, as the Authority may deem necessary or desirable and not inconsistent 
with the Loan Agreement or the Indenture, and which shall not materially adversely affect the interests of the Holders 
of the Bonds; and (iii) to maintain the exclusion from gross income of interest payable with respect to the Bonds. 

In executing any amendment or modification of the Loan Agreement permitted by the provisions of the 
Indenture described under this caption, the Authority shall be entitled to receive and to rely upon an Opinion of 
Counsel stating that the execution of such amendment or modification is authorized or permitted by the Indenture. 

If the Trustee, as holder of Obligation No. 39, is required to provide an approval, a consent or to vote, or to 
consent to an amendment of the Master Indenture (except with respect to the proposed amendment of the Master 
Indenture described above under the caption "Master Indenture –Additional Remedies – Event of Default" and under 
the caption "Master Indenture – Defaults and Remedies – Additional Remedies and Enforcement of Remedies"), the 
Trustee shall be entitled to request and receive the consent and/or direction of the Holders of a majority in principal 
amount of the Bonds Outstanding prior to providing such approval or consent or vote. 

Replacement of Obligation No. 39.  Obligation No. 39 shall be surrendered by the Trustee and delivered to 
the Master Trustee for cancellation upon receipt by the Trustee of the following: (a) a Request of the Corporation 
requesting such surrender and delivery and stating that the Corporation has become a member of an obligated group 
(herein referred to as the "New Group") under a master indenture (other than the Master Indenture) (herein referred to 
as the "Replacement Master Indenture") and that an obligation is being issued to the Trustee under the Replacement 
Master Indenture; (b) a properly executed obligation (the "Replacement Obligation") issued under the Replacement 
Master Indenture and registered in the name of the Trustee with the same tenor and effect as Obligation No. 39 (in a 
principal amount equal to the then-Outstanding principal amount of Bonds), authenticated by the master trustee under 
the Replacement Master Indenture; (c) an Opinion of Counsel to the Corporation to the effect that the Replacement 
Obligation has been validly issued under the Replacement Master Indenture and constitutes a valid and binding 
obligation of the Corporation and each of the other members of the New Group; (d) a Favorable Opinion of Bond 
Counsel; (e) a copy of the Replacement Master Indenture, certified as a true and accurate copy by the master trustee 
under the Replacement Master Indenture; (f) written confirmation from each Rating Agency then rating the Bonds 
that the replacement of Obligation No. 39 will not, by itself, result in a reduction in the then-current ratings on the 
Bonds; and (g) a certificate of the Master Trustee to the effect that Obligation No. 39 has been cancelled.  

Upon satisfaction of the conditions identified above, (i) all references in the Indenture, in the Bonds, in the 
Loan Agreement and in the Tax Agreement to Obligation No. 39 shall be deemed to be references to the Replacement 
Obligation, (ii) all references to the Master Indenture shall be deemed to be references to the Replacement Master 
Indenture, (iii) all references to the Master Trustee shall be deemed to be references to the master trustee under the 
Replacement Master Indenture, (iv) all references to the Obligated Group and the Members of the Obligated Group 
Members shall be deemed to be references to the New Group and the members of the New Group, and (v) all references 
to Supplement No. 39 shall be deemed to be references to the supplemental master indenture pursuant to which the 
Replacement Obligation is issued. 

Events of Default and Remedies 

Events of Default.  The following events shall be Events of Default: 

(a) default in the due and punctual payment of the principal or Redemption Price of any Bond, when 
and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at maturity, by proceedings for redemption, by acceleration 
or otherwise or default in the redemption of any Bonds from Sinking Fund Installments in the amount and at the times 
provided therefor; 



 

 C-42 

(b) default in the due and punctual payment of any installment of interest on any Bond, when and as 
such interest installment shall become due and payable; 

(c) default by the Authority in the observance of any of the other covenants, agreements or conditions 
on its part in the Indenture or in the Bonds, contained, if such default shall have continued for a period of sixty (60) 
days after written notice thereof, specifying such default and requiring the same to be remedied, shall have been given 
to the Authority and the Corporation by the Trustee or to the Authority, the Corporation and the Trustee by the Holders 
of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds at the time Outstanding; or 

(d) a Loan Default Event. 

Acceleration of Maturities.  If an Event of Default shall occur, then, and in each and every such case during 
the continuance of such Event of Default, the Trustee may, and upon the written direction of the Holders of a majority 
in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds then Outstanding, the Trustee shall, notify the Master Trustee of such 
Event of Default, may make a demand for payment under Obligation No. 39 and may request the Master Trustee in 
writing to give notice pursuant to the Master Indenture to the Members of the Obligated Group declaring the principal 
of all obligations issued under the Master Indenture then outstanding to be due and immediately payable.  Upon such 
declaration by the Master Trustee and upon notice in writing to the Authority and the Corporation, the Trustee shall 
declare the principal of the Bonds, and the interest accrued thereon, to be due and payable immediately, and upon any 
such declaration the same shall become and shall be immediately due and payable, anything in the Indenture or in the 
Bonds contained to the contrary notwithstanding.  In addition, the Trustee may take whatever action at law or in equity 
is necessary or desirable to collect the payments due under Obligation No. 39. 

Notice of such declaration having been given as aforesaid, anything to the contrary contained in the Indenture 
or in the Bonds to the contrary notwithstanding, interest shall cease to accrue on such Bonds from and after the date 
of such notice of acceleration. 

Any such declaration, however, is subject to the condition that if, at any time after such declaration and before 
any judgment or decree for the payment of the moneys due shall have been obtained or entered, there shall be deposited 
with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay all the principal or Redemption Price of and installments of interest on the 
Bonds payment of which is overdue, with interest on such overdue principal at the rates borne by the respective Bonds, 
and the reasonable fees, charges and expenses of the Trustee, and if the Trustee has received notification from the 
Master Trustee that the declaration of acceleration of Obligation No. 39 has been annulled pursuant to the Master 
Indenture and any and all other defaults known to the Trustee (other than in the payment of principal of and interest 
on the Bonds due and payable solely by reason of such declaration) shall have been made good or cured to the 
satisfaction of the Trustee or provision deemed by the Trustee to be adequate shall have been made therefor, then, and 
in every such case, the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds Outstanding, 
by written notice to the Authority, the Corporation and the Trustee, or the Trustee may, on behalf of the Holders of all 
the Bonds, rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences and waive such default; provided that no such 
rescission and annulment shall extend to or shall affect any subsequent default or shall impair or exhaust any right or 
power consequent thereon.  In the case of any such rescission and annulment, the Authority, the Corporation, the 
Trustee and the Holders shall be restored to their former positions and rights under the Indenture. 

Application of Revenues and Other Funds after Default.  If an Event of Default shall occur and be 
continuing, all Revenues and any other funds then held or thereafter received by the Trustee under any of the provisions 
of the Indenture (subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to moneys held for particular  Bonds and other 
than moneys required to be deposited in the Rebate Fund) shall be applied by the Trustee as follows and in the 
following order: 

(1) To the payment of any expenses necessary in the opinion of the Trustee to protect the interests of 
the Holders of the Bonds and payment of reasonable fees and expenses of the Trustee (including reasonable fees and 
disbursements of its counsel) incurred in and about the performance of its powers and duties under the Indenture;  

(2) To the payment of the principal or Redemption Price of and interest then due on the Bonds (upon 
presentation of the Bonds to be paid, and stamping thereon of the payment if only partially paid, or surrender thereof 
if fully paid) subject to the provisions of the Indenture, as follows: 



 

 C-43 

(i) Unless the principal of all of the Bonds shall have become or have been declared due and 
payable, 

First:  To the payment to the Persons entitled thereto of all installments of interest then due 
in the order of the maturity of such installments, and, if the amount available shall not be sufficient to pay in 
full any installment or installments maturing on the same date, then to the payment thereof ratably, according 
to the amounts due thereon, to the Persons entitled thereto, without any discrimination or preference;  

Second:  To the payment to the Persons entitled thereto of the unpaid principal (including 
Mandatory Sinking Account Payments) or Redemption Price of any Bonds which shall have become due, 
whether at maturity or by call for redemption, in the order of their due dates, with interest on the overdue 
principal at the rate borne by the respective Bonds, and, if the amount available shall not be sufficient to pay 
in full all the Bonds due on any date, together with such interest, then to the payment thereof ratably, 
according to the amounts of principal or Redemption Price due on such date to the Persons entitled thereto, 
without any discrimination or preference; 

(ii) If the principal of all of the Bonds shall have become or have been declared due and 
payable, to the payment of the principal and interest then due and unpaid upon the Bonds, with interest on 
the overdue principal at the rate borne by the respective Bonds, and, if the amount available shall not be 
sufficient to pay in full the whole amount so due and unpaid, then to the payment thereof ratably, without 
preference or priority of principal over interest, or of interest over principal, or of any installment of interest 
over any other installment of interest, or of any Bond over any other Bond, according to the amounts due 
respectively for principal and interest, to the Persons entitled thereto without any discrimination or 
preference; and 

(3) To the payment of the reasonable fees, charges and expenses of the Authority and the payment of 
any amounts owed pursuant to the provisions of Loan Agreement. 

Trustee to Represent Bondholders.  Upon the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default or other 
occasion giving rise to a right in the Trustee to represent the Bondholders, the Trustee in its discretion may, and upon 
the written request of the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds then Outstanding, 
and upon being indemnified to its satisfaction therefor, shall, proceed to protect or enforce its rights or the rights of 
such Holders by such appropriate action, suit, mandamus or other proceedings as it shall deem most effectual to protect 
and enforce any such right, at law or in equity, either for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement 
contained in the Indenture, or in aid of the execution of any power in the Indenture granted, or for the enforcement of 
any other appropriate legal or equitable right or remedy vested in the Trustee, or in such Holders under the Indenture, 
the Loan Agreement, Obligation No. 39, the Act or any other law; and upon instituting such proceeding, the Trustee 
shall be entitled, as a matter of right, to the appointment of a receiver of the Revenues and other assets pledged under 
the Indenture, pending such proceedings.  If more than one such request is received by the Trustee from the Holders, 
the Trustee shall follow the written request executed by the Holders of the greater percentage of Bonds then 
Outstanding in excess of 25%.  All rights of action under the Indenture or the Bonds or otherwise may be prosecuted 
and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Bonds or the production thereof in any proceeding 
relating thereto, and any such suit, action or proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in the name of the 
Trustee for the benefit and protection of all the Holders of such Bonds, subject to the provisions of the Indenture.  
Nothing in the Indenture shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on 
behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, or composition affecting the Bonds or the 
rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such 
proceeding without the approval of the Holders so affected. 

Bondholders' Direction of Proceedings.  The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the 
Bonds then Outstanding shall have the right, by an instrument or concurrent instruments in writing executed and 
delivered to the Trustee, and upon indemnifying the Trustee to its satisfaction therefor, to direct the method of 
conducting all remedial proceedings taken by the Trustee under the Indenture, provided that such direction shall not 
be otherwise than in accordance with law and the provisions of the Indenture, and that the Trustee shall have the right 
to decline to follow any such direction which in the opinion of the Trustee would be unjustly prejudicial to 
Bondholders not parties to such direction (the Trustee having no duty to make such determination). 



 

 C-44 

Limitation on Bondholders' Right to Sue.  No Holder of any Bond shall have the right to institute any suit, 
action or proceeding at law or in equity, for the protection or enforcement of any right or remedy under the Indenture, 
the Loan Agreement, Obligation No. 39, the Act or any other applicable law with respect to such Bond, unless:  (1) 
such Holder shall have given to the Trustee written notice of the occurrence of an Event of Default; (2) the Holders 
of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds then Outstanding shall have made written request 
upon the Trustee to exercise the powers granted in the Indenture or to institute such suit, action or proceeding in its 
own name; provided, however, that if more than one such request is received by the Trustee from the Holders, the 
Trustee shall follow the written request executed by the Holders of the greater percentage of Bonds then Outstanding 
in excess of 25%; (3) such Holder or said Holders shall have tendered to the Trustee indemnity satisfactory to it against 
the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request; and (4) the Trustee shall have refused 
or omitted to comply with such request for a period of sixty (60) days after such written request shall have been 
received by, and said tender of indemnity shall have been made to, the Trustee. 

Such notification, request, tender of indemnity and refusal or omission are, in every case, to be conditions 
precedent to the exercise by any Holder of Bonds of any remedy under the Indenture or under law; it being understood 
and intended that no one or more Holders of Bonds shall have any right in any manner whatever by his or their action 
to affect, disturb or prejudice the security of the Indenture or the rights of any other Holders of Bonds, or to enforce 
any right under the Indenture, the Loan Agreement, Obligation No. 39, the Act or other applicable law with respect to 
the Bonds, except in the manner in the Indenture provided, and that all proceedings at law or in equity to enforce any 
such right shall be instituted, had and maintained in the manner in the Indenture provided and for the benefit and 
protection of all Holders of the Outstanding Bonds, subject to the provisions of the Indenture. 

Termination of Proceedings.  In case any proceedings taken by the Trustee or any one or more Bondholders 
on account of any Event of Default shall have been discontinued or abandoned for any reason or shall have been 
determined adversely to the Trustee or the Bondholders, then in every such case the Authority, the Trustee and the 
Bondholders, subject to any determination in such proceedings, shall be restored to their former positions and rights 
under the Indenture, severally and respectively, and all rights, remedies, powers and duties of the Authority, the 
Trustee and the Bondholders shall continue as though no such proceedings had been taken. 

Remedies Not Exclusive.  No remedy in the Indenture conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the 
Holders of the Bonds is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy or remedies, and each and every such remedy, 
to the extent permitted by law, shall be cumulative and in addition to any other remedy given under the Indenture or 
now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. 

No Waiver of Default.  No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of the Bonds to exercise any 
right or power arising upon the occurrence of any default shall impair any such right or power or shall be construed 
to be a waiver of any such default or an acquiescence therein; and every power and remedy given by the Indenture to 
the Trustee or to the Holders of the Bonds may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed 
expedient. 

Amendment of the Indenture 

Amendments Permitted.  The Indenture and the rights and obligations of the Authority and of the Holders 
of the Bonds and of the Trustee may be modified or amended from time to time and at any time by an indenture or 
indentures supplemental to the Indenture, which the Authority and the Trustee may enter into when the written consent 
of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds then Outstanding shall have been filed with 
the Trustee; provided, however, that if such amendment will, by its terms, not take effect so long as Bonds of any 
particular interest rate and maturity remain Outstanding, the consent of the Holders of Bonds of such interest rate and 
maturity shall not be required and such Bonds shall not be deemed to be Outstanding for the purpose of any calculation 
of Bonds Outstanding under the provisions of the Indenture.  No such modification or amendment shall (1) extend the 
fixed maturity of any Bond, or reduce the amount of principal thereof, or extend the time of payment or reduce the 
amount of any Mandatory Sinking Account Payment, or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or extend the time of 
payment of interest thereon, without the consent of the Holder of each Bond so affected, or (2) reduce the aforesaid 
percentage of Bonds the consent of the Holders of which is required to effect any such modification or amendment, 
or permit the creation of any lien on the Revenues and other assets pledged under the Indenture prior to or on a parity 
with the lien created by the Indenture, or deprive the Holders of the Bonds of the lien created by the Indenture on such 



 

 C-45 

Revenues and other assets (except as expressly provided in the Indenture), without the consent of the Holders of all 
Bonds then Outstanding. 

The Indenture and the rights and obligations of the Authority, of the Trustee and of the Holders of the Bonds 
may also be modified or amended from time to time and at any time by an indenture or indentures supplemental to the 
Indenture, which the Authority and the Trustee may enter into without the consent of any Holders, but only to the 
extent permitted by law and only for any one or more of the following purposes: 

(1) to add to the covenants and agreements of the Authority contained in the Indenture other covenants 
and agreements thereafter to be observed, to pledge or assign additional security for the Bonds (or any portion thereof), 
or to surrender any right or power in the Indenture reserved to or conferred upon the Authority, provided, that no such 
covenant, agreement, pledge, assignment or surrender shall materially adversely affect the interests of the Holders of 
the Bonds; 

(2) to make such provisions for the purpose of curing any ambiguity, inconsistency or omission, or of 
curing or correcting any defective provision, contained in the Indenture, or in regard to matters or questions arising 
under the Indenture, as the Authority or the Trustee may deem necessary or desirable and not inconsistent with the 
Indenture, and which shall not materially adversely affect the interests of the Holders of the Bonds, as evidenced by 
the Opinion of Counsel delivered pursuant to the Indenture; 

(3) to modify, amend or supplement the Indenture in such manner as to permit the qualification under 
the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, or any similar federal statute hereafter in effect, and to add such other 
terms, conditions and provisions as may be permitted by said act or similar federal statute, and which shall not 
materially adversely affect the interests of the Holders of the Bonds, as evidenced by the Opinion of Counsel delivered 
pursuant to the Indenture; 

(4) to provide any additional procedures, covenants or agreements to maintain the exclusion from gross 
income for federal income tax purposes of interest on the Bonds; 

(5) to make any changes required by a Rating Agency in order to maintain a rating for the Bonds; 

(6) to modify, alter, amend or supplement the Indenture in any other respect which is not materially 
adverse to the Bondholders, as evidenced by the Opinion of Counsel delivered pursuant to the Indenture. 

Defeasance 

Discharge of Bonds and Indenture.  The Bonds may be paid by the Authority or the Trustee on behalf of 
the Authority in any of the following ways:  

(1) by paying or causing to be paid the principal or Redemption Price of and interest on all Bonds 
Outstanding, as and when the same become due and payable; 

(2) by depositing with the Trustee, in trust, at or before maturity, moneys in the necessary amount (as 
provided pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture) to pay when due or redeem all Bonds then Outstanding; or 

(3) by delivering to the Trustee, for cancellation by it, all Bonds then Outstanding. 

If the Authority shall also pay or cause to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture by the Authority 
and if the Corporation shall have paid all Additional Payments, Administrative Fees and Expenses, any 
indemnification owed to the Authority or the Trustee and any other fees and expenses payable to the Authority 
pursuant to the Loan Agreement, then and in that case at the election of the Authority (evidenced by a Certificate of 
the Authority filed with the Trustee signifying the intention of the Authority to discharge all such indebtedness and 
the Indenture and upon receipt by the Trustee and the Authority of an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the 
obligations under the Indenture and the Bonds have been discharged), and notwithstanding that any Bonds shall not 
have been surrendered for payment, the Indenture and the pledge of Revenues and other assets made under the 



 

 C-46 

Indenture and all covenants, agreements and other obligations of the Authority under the Indenture (except as 
otherwise provided in the Indenture) shall cease, terminate, become void and be completely discharged and satisfied. 

Notices 

Notwithstanding any other provision in the Indenture to the contrary, any notice to be delivered to 
Bondholders may be given by Electronic Notice. 

LOAN AGREEMENT 

The Loan Agreement provides the terms of the loan of the proceeds of the Bonds, to the Corporation and the 
repayment of and security for the loan provided by the Corporation. 

Issuance of Obligation No. 39 

In consideration of the issuance of the Bonds by the Authority and the application of the proceeds thereof as 
provided in the Indenture, the Corporation agrees to issue, or cause to be issued, and to cause to be authenticated and 
delivered to the Authority or its designee, pursuant to the Master Indenture and Supplement No. 39, concurrently with 
the issuance and delivery of the Bonds, Obligation No. 39.  The Authority agrees that Obligation No. 39 shall be 
registered in the name of the Trustee. 

Payment of Loan 

Loan of Proceeds; Payment of Principal and Interest.  Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, the Authority 
lends and advances to the Corporation, and the Corporation borrows and accepts from the Authority, the net proceeds 
received from the sale of the Bonds, such proceeds to be applied under the terms and conditions of the Loan Agreement 
and the Indenture.  In consideration of the loan of such proceeds to the Corporation, the Corporation agrees to pay, or 
cause to be paid, Loan Repayments as follows:  (i) on or before the Business Day next preceding each Interest Payment 
Date, the full amount of the interest becoming due and payable on such Interest Payment Date on all Bonds then 
Outstanding (less any amounts on deposit in the Interest Fund available for the payment of such interest) and (ii) on 
or before the Business Day next preceding each Principal Payment Date, the aggregate amount of principal becoming 
due and payable on the Outstanding Bonds, plus the aggregate amount of Mandatory Sinking Account Payments 
required to be paid into the Sinking Accounts for Outstanding Bonds, in each case on such Principal Payment Date 
(less any amounts on deposit in the Principal Fund available for the payment of such principal or Mandatory Sinking 
Account Payments).  Notwithstanding the foregoing schedule of payments, the Corporation agrees to make payments, 
or cause payments to be made, at the times and in the amounts required to be paid as principal of, premium, if any, 
and interest on the Bonds from time to time Outstanding under the Indenture and other amounts required to be paid 
under the Indenture, as the same shall become due whether at maturity, upon redemption, by declaration of 
acceleration or otherwise. 

Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Loan Agreement, all amounts payable by the Corporation to 
the Authority under the Loan Agreement or with respect to Obligation No. 39 shall be paid to the Trustee, as assignee 
of the Authority, and the Loan Agreement and all right, title and interest of the Authority in any such payments shall 
be assigned and pledged to the Trustee so long as any Bonds remain Outstanding. 

Additional Payments.  In addition to Loan Repayments and payments on Obligation No. 39, the Corporation 
shall also pay to the Authority or the Trustee, as the case may be, Additional Payments, as described below.  The 
obligations of the Corporation described under this caption shall survive the resignation and removal of the Trustee, 
payment of the Bonds and discharge of the Indenture.

however, (i) that the Corporation shall have the right to protest any such taxes or assessments and to require the 
Authority, at the Corporation's expense, to protest and contest any such taxes or assessments levied upon them and

adequate by the Authority in respect of such affected rights or interests; 

(b) All amounts payable to the Authority under the Loan Agreement and under the Indenture; 

(c) The reasonable fees and expenses of such accountants, consultants, attorneys and other experts as

(d) The annual fee of the Authority, any and all fees and expenses incurred primarily in connection with 
the authorization, issuance, sale and delivery of any Bonds and reasonable fees and expenses of the Authority or any 
agency of the State selected by the Authority to act on its behalf in connection with the Loan Agreement, Obligation 
No. 39, the Bonds or the Indenture, including, without limitation, in connection with any litigation, investigation, 
inquiry or other proceeding which may at any time be instituted involving the Loan Agreement, Obligation No. 39,

that the Corporation shall have the right to protest any such taxes or assessments and to require the Trustee, at the 
Corporation's expense, to protest and contest any such taxes or assessments levied upon them and (ii) that the

under the Loan Agreement have been paid, at any time or from time to time to prepay all or any part of the Loan 
Repayments, and the Authority agrees that the Trustee shall accept such prepayments when the same are tendered.  
Prepayments may be made by payments of cash, deposit of United States Government Obligations or surrender of 



 

 C-48 

Bonds.  All such prepayments shall be deposited upon receipt in the Special Redemption Account or in the Optional

States of America or of the State, or any political subdivision of either thereof or any failure of the Authority to perform 
and observe any agreement, whether express or implied, or any duty, liability or obligation arising out of or connected 
with the Loan Agreement. 

Continuing Disclosure 

The Corporation, on behalf of itself and the other Members of the Obligated Group, covenants and agrees to 
comply with the continuing disclosure requirements promulgated under the Rule.  Notwithstanding any other 
provision of the Loan Agreement, failure of the Corporation to comply with the requirements of the Rule shall not be 
considered a Loan Default Event; however, the Trustee, at the written request of any Participating Underwriter or the 
Holders of at least 25% aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Bonds, shall, but only to the extent the Trustee is 
indemnified to its satisfaction from and against any cost, liability or expense related thereto, including, without 
limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of its attorneys and advisors and its additional fees and expenses, or any

written notice, specifying such failure or breach and requesting that it be remedied, has been given to the Corporation 
by the Authority or the Trustee; except that, if such failure or breach can be remedied but not within such 60 day 
period and if the Corporation shall have taken all action reasonably possible to remedy such failure or breach within

time established by the Authority, or the Trustee; 

(d) If the Corporation files a petition in voluntary bankruptcy, for the composition of its affairs or for

APPENDIX D 

PROPOSED FORM OF OPINION OF BOND COUNSEL 

[Closing Date] 

California Health Facilities Financing Authority 
Sacramento, California 

California Health Facilities Financing Authority Refunding Revenue Bonds 
(Stanford Health Care), 2017 Series A 

Final Opinion 

Ladies and Gentlemen: 

We have acted as bond counsel to the California Health Facilities Financing Authority (the "Issuer") in 
connection with issuance of $454,200,000 aggregate principal amount of California Health Facilities Financing 
Authority Refunding Revenue Bonds (Stanford Health Care), 2017 Series A (the "Bonds"), issued pursuant to an 
Indenture, dated as of December 1, 2017 (the "Indenture"), between the Issuer and The Bank of New York Mellon 
Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee").  Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the 
meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture. 

In such connection, we have reviewed the Indenture, the Loan Agreement, dated as of December 1 2017 
(the "Loan Agreement"), between the Issuer and Stanford Health Care (the "Borrower"), the Tax Certificate and 
Agreement, dated the date hereof (the "Tax Certificate"), between the Issuer and the Borrower, opinions of counsel 
to the Issuer, the Borrower and the Trustee, certificates of the Issuer, the Borrower, the Trustee and others, and such 
other documents, opinions and matters to the extent we deemed necessary to render the opinions set forth herein. 

We have relied on the opinion of Ropes & Gray LLP, counsel to the Borrower, regarding, among other 
matters, the current qualification of the Borrower as an organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code").  We note that the opinion is subject to a number of qualifications and 
limitations.  We have also relied upon representations of the Borrower regarding the use of the facilities financed or 
refinanced with the proceeds of the Bonds in activities that are not considered unrelated trade or business activities 
of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 513 of the Code.  We note that the opinion of counsel to the 
Borrower does not address Section 513 of the Code.  Failure of the Borrower to be organized and operated in 
accordance with the Internal Revenue Service's requirements for the maintenance of its status as an organization 
described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Code, or use of the bond-financed or refinanced facilities in activities that are 
considered unrelated trade or business activities of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 513 of the Code, 
may result in interest on the Bonds being included in gross income for federal income tax purposes, possibly from 
the date of issuance of the Bonds. 

The opinions expressed herein are based on an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court 
decisions and cover certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities.  Such opinions may be affected by 
actions taken or omitted or events occurring after the date hereof.  We have not undertaken to determine, or to 
inform any person, whether any such actions are taken or omitted or events do occur or any other matters come to 
our attention after the date hereof.  Accordingly, this letter speaks only as of its date and is not intended to, and may 
not, be relied upon or otherwise used in connection with any such actions, events or matters.  We disclaim any 
obligation to update this letter.  We have assumed the genuineness of all documents and signatures presented to us 
(whether as originals or as copies) and the due and legal execution and delivery thereof by, and validity against, any 
parties other than the Issuer.  We have assumed, without undertaking to verify, the accuracy of the factual matters 
represented, warranted or certified in the documents, and of the legal conclusions contained in the opinions, referred 
to in the second and third paragraphs hereof.  Furthermore, we have assumed compliance with all covenants and 
agreements contained in the Indenture, the Loan Agreement and the Tax Certificate, including (without limitation) 
covenants and agreements compliance with which is necessary to assure that future actions, omissions or events will 
not cause interest on the Bonds to be included in gross income for federal income tax purposes.  We call attention to 
the fact that the rights and obligations under the Bonds, the Indenture, the Loan Agreement and the Tax Certificate 
and their enforceability may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization, arrangement, 



 D-2  

fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights, to the application of 
equitable principles, to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases and to the limitations on legal 
remedies against authorities of the State of California.  We express no opinion with respect to any indemnification, 
contribution, liquidated damages, penalty (including any remedy deemed to constitute a penalty), right of set-off, 
arbitration, judicial reference, choice of law, choice of forum, choice of venue, non-exclusivity of remedies, waiver 
or severability provisions contained in the foregoing documents, nor do we express any opinion with respect to the 
state or quality of title to or interest in any of the assets described in or as subject to the lien of the Indenture or the 
Loan Agreement or the accuracy or sufficiency of the description contained therein of, or the remedies available to 
enforce liens on, any such assets.  Our services did not include financial or other non-legal advice.  Finally, we 
undertake no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the Official Statement or other offering 
material relating to the Bonds and express no opinion with respect thereto. 

Based on and subject to the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, as of the date hereof, we are of the following 
opinions: 

1. The Bonds constitute the valid and binding limited obligations of the Issuer. 

2. The Indenture has been duly executed and delivered by, and constitutes the valid and binding 
obligation of, the Issuer.  The Indenture creates a valid pledge, to secure the payment of the principal of and interest 
on the Bonds, of the Revenues and any other amounts held by the Trustee in any fund or account established 
pursuant to the Indenture, except the Rebate Fund, subject to the provisions of the Indenture permitting the 
application thereof for the purposes and on the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture. 

3. The Loan Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by, and constitutes a valid and binding 
agreement of, the Issuer. 

4. The Bonds are not a lien or charge upon the funds or property of the Issuer except to the extent of 
the aforementioned pledge.  Neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the State of California or of any 
political subdivision thereof is pledged to the payment of the principal of or interest on the Bonds.  The Bonds are 
not a debt of the State of California, and said State is not liable for the payment thereof. 

5. Interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under 
Section 103 of the Code and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes.  Interest on the Bonds is not 
a specific preference item for purposes of the federal individual or corporate alternative minimum taxes, although 
we observe that it is included in adjusted current earnings when calculating corporate alternative minimum taxable 
income.  We express no opinion regarding other tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or the 
amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the Bonds. 

Faithfully yours,

APPENDIX E

BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM

The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), New York, New York, will act as securities depository for the 
Bonds.  The Bonds will be issued as fully-registered securities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s 
partnership nominee) or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC.  One fully-

registered Bond certificate will be issued in the aggregate principal amount of each maturity of the Bonds, and will 
be deposited with DTC.

DTC, the world’s largest securities depository, is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New 

York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the 
Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, 
and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 

1934, as amended.  DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 3.5 million issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity 
issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market instruments (from over 100 countries) that DTC’s 
participants (“Direct Participants”) deposit with DTC.  DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct 

Participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-
entry transfers and pledges between Direct Participants’ accounts.  This eliminates the need for physical movement 
of securities certificates.  Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, 

trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations.  DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The 
Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”).  DTCC is the holding company of DTC, National Securities 
Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies.  DTCC 

is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries.  Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both 
U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear 
through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly (“Indirect 

Participants”).  DTC has a Standard & Poor’s rating of AA+.  The DTC Rules applicable to its Participants are on 
file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  More information about DTC can be found at www.dtcc.com.

Purchases of Bonds under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will 

receive a credit for the Bonds on DTC’s records.  The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each Bond 
(“Beneficial Owner”) is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants’ records.  Beneficial Owners 
will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase.  Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to 

receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, 
from the Direct or Indirect Participant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction.  Transfers of 
ownership interests in the Bonds are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect

Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners.  Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing 
their beneficial ownership interests in the Bonds, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Bonds 
is discontinued.

To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Bonds deposited by Direct Participants with DTC are registered in the 
name of DTC’s partnership nominee, Cede & Co. or such other name as may be requested by an authorized 
representative of DTC.  The deposit of Bonds with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such 

other DTC nominee do not effect any change in beneficial ownership.  DTC has no knowledge of the actual 
Beneficial Owners of the Bonds; DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts 
such Bonds are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners.  The Direct and Indirect Participants will 

remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.

Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by Direct Participants to 
Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by 

arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time.  
Beneficial Owners of Bonds may wish to take certain steps to augment the transmission to them of notices of 
significant events with respect to the Bonds, such as redemptions, defaults, and proposed amendments to the Bond 

documents.  For example, Beneficial Owners of Bonds may wish to ascertain that the nominee holding the Bonds 
for their benefit has agreed to obtain and transmit notices to Beneficial Owners.  In the alternative, Beneficial 



E-2

Owners may wish to provide their names and addresses to the Trustee and request that copies of notices be provided 
directly to them.

Redemption notices shall be sent to DTC.  If less than all of the Bonds are being redeemed, DTC’s practice 
is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each Direct Participant in such Bonds to be redeemed.

Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to Bonds 

unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC’s Money Market Instrument Procedures.  Under 
its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to the Authority as soon as possible after the record date.  The 
Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede & Co.’s consenting or voting rights to those Direct Participants to whose accounts 

Bonds are credited on the record date (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy).

Principal, premium, redemption proceeds, and interest payments on the Bonds will be made to Cede & Co., 
or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC.  DTC’s practice is to credit 

Direct Participants’ accounts upon DTC’s receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from the Authority 
or the Trustee, on a payment date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC’s records.  Payments 
by Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the 

case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in “street name,” and will be the
responsibility of such Participants and not of DTC nor of its nominee, the Trustee, the Corporation or the Authority, 
subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time.  Payment of principal, 

premium, redemption proceeds, and interest to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee as may be requested by an 
authorized representative of DTC) is the responsibility of the Corporation, the Authority or the Trustee, 
disbursement of such payments to Direct Participants will be the responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such 

payments to the Beneficial Owners will be the responsibility of Direct and Indirect Participants.

DTC may discontinue providing its services as depository with respect to the Bonds at any time by giving 
reasonable notice to the Authority or the Trustee.  Under such circumstances, in the event that a successor securities 

depository is not obtained, Bond certificates are required to be printed and delivered.

The Authority may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry only transfers through DTC (or a 
successor securities depository).  In that event, Bond certificates will be printed and delivered to DTC.

The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC’s book-entry system has been obtained from 
sources that the Authority and the Corporation believe to be reliable, but neither the Authority nor the Corporation 
takes responsibility for the accuracy thereof.

The Authority, the Corporation and the Underwriters cannot and do not give any assurances that 
DTC will distribute to Participants or that Participants or others will distribute to the Beneficial Owners 
payments of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds paid or any redemption or other notices 
or that they will do so on a timely basis or will serve and act in the manner described in this Official 
Statement.  Neither the Authority nor the Corporation is responsible or liable for the failure of DTC or any 
Direct Participant or Indirect Participant to make any payments or give any notice to a Beneficial Owner 
with respect to the Bonds or any error or delay relating thereto.

None of the Authority, the Corporation, the Underwriters or the Trustee will have any responsibility 
or obligation to Direct Participants, to Indirect Participants or to any Beneficial Owner with respect to (i) the 
accuracy of any records maintained by DTC, any Direct Participant, or any Indirect Participant; (ii) the 
payment by DTC or any Direct Participant or Indirect Participant of any amount with respect to the 
principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Bonds; (iii) any notice that is permitted or required to be 
given to Holders under the Indenture; (iv) the selection by DTC, any Direct Participant or any Indirect 
Participant of any person to receive payment in the event of a partial redemption of the Bonds; (v) any 
consent given or other action taken by DTC as Bondholder; or (vi) any other procedures or obligations of 
DTC, Direct Participants or Indirect Participants under the book-entry system.

or cause a notice of such occurrence to be filed, with the Repository.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, notice of the 
Listed Event described in Section 5(A)(7) or Section 5(B)(3) need not be given under this Section 5(C) any earlier 
than the notice (if any) of the underlying event is given to Holders of affected Bonds pursuant to the Indenture. 

(D) The Dissemination Agent shall, within one (1) Business Day, or as soon thereafter as 
practicable, of obtaining actual knowledge of the occurrence of any of the Listed Events described in Section 5(B), 

F-4



 

contact the Disclosure Representative, inform such person of the event, and request that the Corporation promptly 
direct the Dissemination Agent in writing whether or not to report such event pursuant to Section 5(H).  For 
purposes of this Disclosure Agreement, "actual knowledge" of the occurrence of such Listed Events shall mean 
actual knowledge by the officer at the Dissemination Agent with regular responsibility for the administration of 
matters related to this Disclosure Agreement.  The Dissemination Agent shall not have any duty to determine if any 
Listed Event is material or reflects financial difficulties. 

(E) Whenever the Corporation obtains knowledge of the occurrence of a Listed Event 
described in Section 5(B), whether because of a notice from the Dissemination Agent pursuant to Section 5(D) or 
otherwise, the Corporation shall as soon as possible determine if such event would be material under applicable 
federal securities laws. 

(F) If the Corporation has determined that knowledge of the occurrence of a Listed Event 
described in Section 5(B) would be material under applicable federal securities laws, the Corporation shall promptly 
notify the Dissemination Agent in writing.  Such notice shall instruct the Dissemination Agent to report the 
occurrence pursuant to Section 5(H). 

(G) If in response to a request under Section 5(D), the Corporation determines that the Listed 
Event described in Section 5(B) would not be material under applicable federal securities laws, the Corporation shall 
so notify the Dissemination Agent in writing and instruct the Dissemination Agent not to report the occurrence 
pursuant to Section 5(H). 

(H) If the Dissemination Agent has been instructed by the Corporation to report the 
occurrence of a Listed Event described in Section 5(B), the Dissemination Agent shall file a notice of such 
occurrence with the Repository, such notice to be provided in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 14. 

SECTION 6. Termination of Reporting Obligation.  The obligations of the Corporation and 
the Dissemination Agent under this Disclosure Agreement shall terminate with respect to the Bonds upon the legal 
defeasance, prior redemption or payment in full of all of the Bonds.  If the obligations of the Corporation under the 
Loan Agreement are assumed in full by some other entity, such person shall be responsible for compliance with this 
Disclosure Agreement in the same manner as if it were the Corporation, and the original Corporation shall have no 
further responsibility hereunder.  

SECTION 7. Dissemination Agent.  The Corporation may, from time to time, appoint or 
engage a Dissemination Agent to assist it in carrying out its obligations under this Disclosure Agreement, and may 
discharge any such Dissemination Agent, with or without appointing a successor Dissemination Agent.  In the event 
that the Corporation discharges the Dissemination Agent and does not appoint a successor Dissemination Agent, the 
Corporation shall perform the obligations of the Dissemination Agent under this Disclosure Agreement. 

The Dissemination Agent may resign by providing thirty (30) days written notice to the 
Corporation and the Trustee.  If at any time there is not any other designated Dissemination Agent, the Corporation 
shall perform the functions of the Dissemination Agent.  Neither the Dissemination Agent nor the Trustee shall have 
any duty or obligation to review any information provided to the Dissemination Agent or Trustee hereunder and 
shall not be deemed to be acting in any fiduciary capacity under this Disclosure Agreement for the Corporation, any 
other Member of the Obligated Group or the Holders. 

It is understood and agreed that any information that the Dissemination Agent may be instructed to 
file with the Repository shall be prepared and provided to it by the Corporation.  The Dissemination Agent has 
undertaken no responsibility with respect to any reports, notices or disclosures provided to it under this Disclosure 
Agreement, and has no liability to any person, including any Holder of Bonds, with respect to any such reports, 
notices or disclosures.  The fact that the Dissemination Agent or any affiliate thereof may have any fiduciary or 
banking relationship with the Corporation shall not be construed to mean that the Dissemination Agent has actual 
knowledge of any event or condition except as may be provided by written notice from the Corporation. 

F-5



 

SECTION 8. Amendment; Waiver.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Disclosure 
Agreement, the Corporation and the Dissemination Agent may amend this Disclosure Agreement (and the 
Dissemination Agent shall agree to any amendment so requested by the Corporation, provided, the Dissemination 
Agent shall not be obligated to enter into any such amendment that modifies or increases its duties or obligations 
hereunder or modifies its rights hereunder), and any provision of this Disclosure Agreement may be waived, 
provided that the following conditions are satisfied: 

(A) If the amendment or waiver relates to the provisions of Sections 3(A), 4, 5(A) or 5(B), 
such amendment or waiver may only be made in connection with a change in circumstances that arises 
from a change in legal requirements, change in law, or change in the identity, nature or status of an 
obligated person with respect to the Bonds, or the type of business conducted; 

(B) This Disclosure Agreement, as amended or taking into account the waiver proposed, 
would, in the opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel, have complied with the requirements of the 
Rule at the time of the original issuance of the Bonds, after taking into account any amendments or 
interpretations of the Rule, as well as any change in circumstances; and 

(C) The amendment or waiver either (i) is approved by the Holders of the Bonds in the same 
manner as provided in the Indenture with respect to amendments to the Indenture which require the consent 
of Holders, or (ii) does not, in the opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel, materially impair the 
interests of the Holders or Beneficial Owners of the Bonds. 

In the event of any amendment or waiver of a provision of this Disclosure Agreement, the Corporation shall describe 
such amendment in the next Annual Report, and shall include, as applicable, a narrative explanation of the reason 
for the amendment or waiver and its impact on the type (or in the case of a change of accounting principles, on the 
presentation) of financial information or operating data being presented by the Corporation.  In addition, if the 
amendment relates to the accounting principles to be followed in preparing financial statements, (i) notice of such 
change shall be given in a filing with the Repository, and (ii) the Annual Report for the year in which the change is 
made should present a comparison (in narrative form and also, if feasible, in quantitative form) between the financial
