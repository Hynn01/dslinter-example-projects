                           to adopt their proposed construction of two disputed phrases. In addition, O2 Micro moves
                           for summary judgment based on collateral estoppel. Defendants oppose the motion and
                           cross-move for summary judgment. O2 Micro opposes their motion for summary judgment. The
                           matters were heard on October 27, 2006. Having considered the parties’ papers, the evidence
                           cited therein and oral argument, the Court construes the disputed terms and phrases as set
                           forth below. In addition, the Court denies O2 Micro’s motion for summary judgment and grants
