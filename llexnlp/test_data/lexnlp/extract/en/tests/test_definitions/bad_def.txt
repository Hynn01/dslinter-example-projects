The

Section
1. Agreement to Act as Placement Agent.

(a) On
the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements of the Company herein contained, and subject to all the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Placement Agent shall be the exclusive Placement Agent in connection with the offering and sale
by the Company of the Securities pursuant to the Company’s registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-222535) (as
amended from time to time and including the exhibits thereto at any given time, the “Registration Statement”),
with the terms of such offering (the “Offering”) to be subject to market conditions and negotiations between
the Company, the Placement Agent and the prospective Investors. The Placement Agent will act on a reasonable best efforts basis
and the Company agrees and acknowledges that there is no guarantee of the successful placement of the Securities, or any portion
thereof, in the prospective Offering. Under no circumstances will the Placement Agent or any of its “Affiliates” (as
defined below) be obligated to underwrite or purchase any of the Securities for its own account or otherwise provide any financing.
The Placement Agent shall act solely as the Company’s agent and not as principal. The Placement Agent shall have no authority
to bind the Company with respect to any prospective offer to purchase Securities and the Company shall have the sole right to
accept offers to purchase Securities and may reject any such offer, in whole or in part. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof,
payment of the purchase price for, and delivery of, the Securities shall be made at one or more closings (each a “Closing”
and the date on which each Closing occurs, a “Closing Date”). As compensation for services rendered, on each
Closing Date, the Company shall pay to the Placement Agent the fees and expenses set forth below:

(i) A
cash fee equal to 7% of the gross proceeds received by the Company from the sale of the Securities at the Closing.

(ii) The
Company also agrees to reimburse Placement Agent’s expenses (with supporting invoices/receipts) up to a maximum of $55,000,
payable immediately upon a Closing of the Offering.

(b) In
addition to the foregoing fees and expenses, the Company acknowledges that at the first Closing of this Offering, the Company
shall pay the Placement Agent an additional $60,000, representing fees earned by the Placement Agent for serving as placement
agent to the Company in the private placement of the Company’s securities pursuant to its securities purchase agreement
dated October 26, 2017 (the “October 2017 Placement”).

(c) The
term of the Placement Agent’s exclusive engagement will be until the February 28, 2018.
