Plaintiff O2 Micro International Limited and Defendants Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.
(MPS), Michael Hsing, Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd. (ASMC), ASUSTeK
Computer, Inc., and Compal Electronics, Inc. (collectively, Defendants) dispute the meaning
of terms and phrases used in 02 Micro’s U.S. Patent No. 6,259,615 (the ‘615 patent), its
U.S. Patent No. 6,396,722 (the ‘722 patent) and its U.S. Patent No. 6,804,129 (the ‘129
patent) .1 02 Micro requests that the Court adopts the claim constructions previously
adopted by this Court and by the Eastern District of Texas court. Defendants ask the Court
to adopt their proposed construction of two disputed phrases. In addition, O2 Micro moves
for summary judgment based on collateral estoppel. Defendants oppose the motion and
cross-move for summary judgment. O2 Micro opposes their motion for summary judgment. The
matters were heard on October 27, 2006. Having considered the parties’ papers, the evidence
cited therein and oral argument, the Court construes the disputed terms and phrases as set
forth below. In addition, the Court denies O2 Micro’s motion for summary judgment and grants
in part Defendants’ motion for summary judgment and denies it in part. BACKGROUND I. Patents
at issue The ‘615, ‘722 and ‘129 patents are all entitled: “High-Efficiency Adaptive DC/AC
Converter.” They are related to the same technology: the ‘129 patent is a continuation of
the ‘722
