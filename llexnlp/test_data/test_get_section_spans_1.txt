Unless otherwise defined herein, all capitalized terms used herein and defined

                             W I T N E S S E T H :
                             - - - - - - - - - -  


          WHEREAS, subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth
herein, the Banks are willing to make available to the Borrower the credit

              NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS AGREED:

              SECTION 1.  Amount and Terms of Credit.
                          -------------------------- 

          1.01  Loan Commitments.  Subject to and upon the terms and conditions
                ----------------                                               
herein set forth, each Bank severally agrees to make a loan or loans to the
Borrower, which loans shall be drawn, to the extent such Bank has a commitment
under such Facility, under the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit
Facility, as set forth below:

          (a)  Loans under the Term Loan Facility (each a "Term Loan" and,
     collectively, the "Term Loans") (i) may be incurred by the Borrower
     pursuant to not more than three drawings, which may occur at any time and
     from time to time on and after the Initial Borrowing Date and prior to the
     Term Loan Availability Termination Date, (ii) except as hereinafter
     provided, may, at the option of the Borrower, be incurred and maintained
     as, and/or converted into, Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Loans, provided
                                                                     --------
     that (x) no Eurodollar Loans may be incurred (including as a result of a
     conversion) prior to the Syndication Date and (y) all Term Loans made by
     all Banks pursuant to the same Borrowing shall, unless otherwise
     specifically provided herein, consist entirely
<PAGE>
 
     of Term Loans of the same Type and (iii) shall not exceed in aggregate
     principal amount for any Bank at the time of incurrence thereof the
     remaining Term Loan Commitment, if any, of such Bank at such time (before
     giving effect to any reductions on such date pursuant to Section 3.03(c)(i)
     or (ii)).  Once repaid, Term Loans borrowed hereunder may not be

          (b)  Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility (each a "Revolving

     Borrower at any time and from time to time on and after the Initial
     Borrowing Date and prior to the Revolving Credit Facility Maturity Date,
     (ii) except as hereinafter provided, may, at the option of the Borrower,
     be incurred and maintained as, and/or converted into, Base Rate Loans or

                       --------                                                
     pursuant to the same Borrowing shall, unless otherwise specifically
     provided herein, consist entirely of Revolving Loans of the same Type and
     (y) no Eurodollar Loans may be incurred prior to the Syndication Date,
     (iii) may be repaid and reborrowed in accordance with the provisions
     hereof, (iv) shall not exceed in aggregate principal amount for any Bank at
     any time outstanding the amount which, when combined with such Bank's
     Percentage of the Letter of Credit Outstandings at such time, equals the
     Revolving Commitment of such Bank at such time and (v) shall not exceed in
     aggregate principal amount for all Banks at any time outstanding the amount
     which, when added to the aggregate amount of Letter of Credit Outstandings
     at such time, equals the lesser of (x) the Borrowing Base then in effect
     and (y) the Total Revolving Commitment at such time.  Notwithstanding
     anything to the contrary contained herein, no Revolving Loan may be
     incurred by the Borrower the proceeds of which shall be used to finance all
     or any portion of any Common Stock Repurchase prior to the date on which
     the Total Term Loan Commitment is terminated in its entirety in accordance

                -------------------                                       
Borrower on the Initial Borrowing Date shall be set forth in a written notice
(or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) delivered by the Borrower
to the Administrative Agent at its Notice Office no later than 12:00 Noon (New
York time) on the Business Day immediately prior to the Initial Borrowing Date.
Whenever the Borrower desires to incur Loans after the Initial Borrowing Date,
it shall give the Administrative Agent at its Notice Office, written notice (or
telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) of each Borrowing of Eurodollar
Loans prior to 12:00 Noon (New York time) on the third Business Day preceding
the date of the proposed Borrowing and written notice (or telephonic notice
promptly confirmed in writing) of each Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be made
hereunder prior to 10:00 A.M. (New York time) on the date of the proposed
Borrowing.  Each of the foregoing notices (each a "Notice of Borrowing") shall
be irrevocable, and, in the case of each written notice and each confirmation of
telephonic notice, shall be in the form of Exhibit A-1, appropriately completed
to specify (i) the Facility pursuant to which Loans are to be incurred, (ii) the
aggregate principal amount of the Loans to be incurred, (iii) the date of
incurrence (which shall be a Business Day), (iv) whether the respective
incurrence shall consist of Base Rate Loans or, to the extent otherwise
permitted, Eurodollar Loans and, if Eurodollar Loans, the Interest Period to be
initially applicable thereto and (v) if Revolving Loans are to be incurred, the
aggregate principal amount of such Revolving Loans, if any, to be used to
finance a Common Stock Repurchase.  The Administrative Agent shall promptly give
each Bank written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing)
of each proposed Borrowing, of the proportionate share thereof of each Bank and
of the other matters covered by the Notice of Borrowing.

          (b)  Without in any way limiting the obligation of the Borrower to
confirm in writing any notice it may give hereunder by telephone, the
Administrative Agent or the respective Letter of Credit Issuer (in the case of
the issuance of Letters of Credit), as the case may be, may act prior to receipt
of written confirmation without liability upon the basis of such telephonic
notice, reasonably believed by the Administrative Agent or such Letter of Credit
Issuer, as the case may be, in good faith to be from an Authorized Officer of
the Borrower as a person entitled to give telephonic notices under this
Agreement on behalf of such Borrower.  In each such case the Borrower hereby
waives the right to dispute the Administrative Agent's record of the terms of
any such telephonic notice.

          (b)  Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Bank from its
obligation to fulfill its commitments hereunder to make Loans or to prejudice
any rights which the Borrower may have against any Bank as a result of any
default by such Bank hereunder.

or dates on which interest has been paid in respect of the Loans evidenced
thereby.  Failure to make any such notation shall not affect the Borrower's
obligations in respect of such Loans, or affect the validity of such transfer by
any Bank of such Note.

          1.06  Conversions.  The Borrower shall have the option to convert on
                -----------                                                   
any Business Day occurring on and after the Syndication Date, all or a portion
at least equal to the applicable Minimum Borrowing Amount of the outstanding
principal amount of the Loans owing pursuant to a single Facility into a
Borrowing or Borrowings pursuant to such Facility of another Type of Loan,
provided that (i) except as provided in Section 1.10(b), Eurodollar Loans may be
- - - --------                                                                        
converted into Loans of another Type only on the last day of an Interest Period
applicable thereto and no partial conversion of a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans
shall reduce the outstanding principal amount of the Loans pursuant to such
Borrowing to less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount applicable thereto, (ii)
Loans may only be converted into Eurodollar Loans if no Default or Event of
Default is in existence on the date of the conversion and (iii) Borrowings of
Eurodollar Loans resulting from this Section 1.06 shall be limited in number as
provided in Section 1.02.  Each such conversion shall be effected by the
Borrower by giving the Administrative Agent at its Notice Office, prior to 12:00
Noon (New York time), at least three Business Days or, in the case of a
conversion into Base Rate Loans, prior to 10:00 A.M. (New York time) on the same
Business Day, prior written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in
writing) (each a "Notice of Conversion") specifying the Loans to be so
converted, the Type of Loans to be converted into and, if to be converted into a
Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans, the Interest Period to be initially applicable
thereto.  The Administrative Agent shall give each Bank prompt notice of any
such proposed conversion affecting any of its Loans.

          1.07  Pro Rata Borrowings.  All Borrowings of Loans shall be made from
                -------------------                                             
the Banks pro rata on the basis of their Term Loan Commitments or Revolving
          --- ----                                                         
Commitments, as the case may be.  It is understood that no Bank shall be
responsible for any default by any other Bank in its obligation to make Loans
hereunder and that each Bank shall be obligated to make the Loans provided to be
made by it hereunder, regardless of the failure of any other Bank to fulfill its
commitments hereunder.

          1.08  Interest.  (a)  The unpaid principal amount of each Base Rate
                --------                                                     
Loan shall bear interest from and including

<PAGE>
 
the date of the Borrowing thereof until maturity (whether by acceleration or
otherwise) at a rate per annum which shall at all times be the Base Rate in
effect from time to time plus the Applicable Base Rate Margin.

          (b)  The unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Loan shall bear
interest from and including the date of the Borrowing thereof until maturity
(whether by acceleration or otherwise) at a rate per annum which shall at all
times be the relevant Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Eurodollar Margin.

          (c)  Overdue principal and, to the extent permitted by law, overdue
interest in respect of each Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal
to the Base Rate in effect from time to time plus the sum of (i) 2% and (ii) the
Applicable Base Rate Margin, provided that no Loan shall bear interest after
                             --------                                       
maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) at a rate per annum less than
2% plus the rate of interest applicable thereto at maturity.

          (d)  Interest shall accrue from and including the date of any
Borrowing to but excluding the date of any repayment thereof and shall be
payable in arrears (i) in respect of each Base Rate Loan, quarterly on the last
Business Day of each calendar quarter, (ii) in respect of each Eurodollar Loan,
on the last day of each Interest Period applicable thereto and, in the case of
an Interest Period of six months, on the date occurring three months after the
first day of such Interest Period and (iii) in respect of each Loan, on any
prepayment (on the amount prepaid), at maturity (whether by acceleration or
otherwise) and, after such maturity, on demand.

          (e)  All computations of interest hereunder shall be made in
accordance with Section 12.07(b).

          (f)  The Administrative Agent, upon determining the interest rate for
any Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans for any Interest Period, shall promptly notify
the Borrower and the Banks thereof.

          1.09  Interest Periods.  At the time the Borrower gives a Notice of
                ----------------                                             
Borrowing or Notice of Conversion in respect of the making of, or conversion
into, a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans (in the case of the initial Interest
Period applicable thereto) or prior to 12:00 Noon (New York time) on the third
Business Day prior to the expiration of an Interest Period applicable to a
Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans (in the

                                      -7-
<PAGE>
 
case of any subsequent Interest Period), it shall have the right to elect by
giving the Administrative Agent written notice (or telephonic notice promptly
confirmed in writing) of the Interest Period applicable to such Borrowing, which
Interest Period shall, at the option of the Borrower, be a one, two, three or
six month period.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above:

          (i)  the initial Interest Period for any Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans
     shall commence on the date of such Borrowing (including the date of any
     conversion from a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans) and each Interest Period
     occurring thereafter in respect of such Borrowing shall commence on the day
     on which the next preceding Interest Period expires;

         (ii)  if any Interest Period applicable to a Borrowing of Eurodollar
     Loans begins on a day for which there is no numerically corresponding day
     in the calendar month at the end of such Interest Period, such Interest
     Period shall end on the last Business Day of such calendar month;

        (iii)  if any Interest Period would otherwise expire on a day which is
     not a Business Day, such Interest Period shall expire on the next
     succeeding Business Day, provided that if any Interest Period applicable to
                              --------                                          
     a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans would otherwise expire on a day which is
     not a Business Day but is a day of the month after which no further
     Business Day occurs in such month, such Interest Period shall expire on the
     next preceding Business Day;

         (iv)  no Interest Period in respect of any Borrowing of Loans under any
     Facility shall extend beyond the respective Maturity Date for such Loans
     under such Facility;

          (v)  no Interest Period may be elected at any time when a Default or
     Event of Default is then in existence;

         (vi)  no Interest Period with respect to any Borrowing of Term Loans
     shall extend beyond any date upon which a Scheduled Repayment is required
     to be made, if, after giving effect to the selection of such Interest
     Period, the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans maintained as
     Eurodollar Loans with Interest Periods ending after such date would exceed
     the aggregate

                                      -8-
<PAGE>
 
     principal amount of Term Loans permitted to be outstanding after such
     Scheduled Repayment; and

       (vii)  all Eurodollar Loans comprising a Borrowing shall at all times
     have the same Interest Period.

If upon the expiration of any Interest Period, the Borrower has failed to elect
a new Interest Period to be applicable to the respective Borrowing of Eurodollar
Loans as provided above, or is unable to elect a new Interest Period as a result
of clause (v) above, the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to convert
such Borrowing into a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans effective as of the
expiration date of such current Interest Period.

          1.10  Increased Costs, Illegality, etc.  (a)  In the event that (x) in
                ---------------------------------                               
the case of clause (i) below, the Administrative Agent or (y) in the case of
clauses (ii) and (iii) below, any Bank shall have determined (which determin-
ation shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all
parties hereto):

          (i)  on any date for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any Interest
     Period that, by reason of any changes arising after the date of this
     Agreement affecting the London interbank Eurodollar market, adequate and
     fair means do not exist for ascertaining generally the applicable interest
     rate on the basis provided for in the definition of Eurodollar Rate; or

         (ii)  at any time, that such Bank shall incur increased costs or
     reductions in the amounts received or receivable hereunder with respect to
     any Eurodollar Loans (other than any increased cost or reduction in the
     amount received or receivable resulting from the imposition of or a change
     in the rate of taxes or similar charges) because of (x) any change since
     the date of this Agreement in any applicable law, governmental rule,
     regulation, guideline, order or request (whether or not having the force of
     law) or in the interpretation or administration thereof and including the
     introduction of any new law or governmental rule, regulation, guideline,
     order or request (such as, for example, but not limited to, a change in
     official reserve requirements, but, in all events, excluding reserves
     referred to in Section 1.10(d)) and/or (y) other circumstances adversely
     affecting the London interbank Eurodollar market or the position of such
     Bank in such market; or

                                      -9-
<PAGE>
 
        (iii) at any time, that the making or continuance of any Eurodollar Loan
     has become unlawful by compliance by such Bank in good faith with any law,
     governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order (or would conflict with
     any such governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order not having the
     force of law but with which such Bank customarily complies even though the
     failure to comply therewith would not be unlawful), or has become
     impracticable as a result of a contingency occurring after the date of this
     Agreement which adversely affects the London interbank Eurodollar market;

then, and in any such event, such Bank (or the Administrative Agent in the case
of clause (i) above) shall promptly give notice (by telephone confirmed in
writing) to the Borrower and (except in the case of clause (i)) to the
Administrative Agent of such determination (which notice the Administrative
Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the other Banks).  Thereafter (x) in
the case of clause (i) above, Eurodollar Loans shall no longer be available
until such time as the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Banks
that the circumstances giving rise to such notice by the Administrative Agent no
longer exist, and any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion given by the
Borrower with respect to Eurodollar Loans which have not yet been incurred shall
be deemed rescinded by such Borrower, (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, the
Borrower shall, subject to the provisions of Section 1.14 (to the extent
applicable), pay to such Bank, upon written demand therefor, such additional
amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a different method of
calculating, interest or otherwise as such Bank in its reasonable discretion
shall determine) as shall be required to compensate such Bank for such increased
costs or reductions in amounts receivable hereunder and (z) in the case of
clause (iii) above, the Borrower shall take one of the actions specified in
Section 1.10(b) as promptly as possible and, in any event, within the time
period required by law.

          (b)  At any time that any Eurodollar Loan is affected by the
circumstances described in Section 1.10(a)(ii) or (iii), the Borrower may (and
in the case of a Eurodollar Loan affected pursuant to Section 1.10(a)(iii),
shall) either (i) if the affected Eurodollar Loan is then being made pursuant
to a Borrowing, cancel said Borrowing by giving the Administrative Agent
telephonic notice (confirmed promptly in writing) thereof on the same date that
the Borrower was notified by a Bank pursuant to Section 1.10(a)(ii) or (iii),
or (ii) if the affected Eurodollar Loan is then

                                      -10-
<PAGE>
 
outstanding, upon at least three Business Days' notice to the Administrative
Agent, require the affected Bank to convert each such Eurodollar Loan into a
Base Rate Loan (which conversion, in the case of the circumstances described in
Section 1.10(a)(iii), shall occur no later than the last day of the Interest
Period then applicable to such Eurodollar Loan (or such earlier date as shall be
required by applicable law)); provided that if more than one Bank is affected at
                              --------                                          
any time, then all affected Banks must be treated the same pursuant to this
Section 1.10(b).

          (c)  If any Bank determines at any time that the adoption or
effectiveness after the Effective Date of any applicable law, rule or regulation
regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein after the Effective Date, or
any change after the Effective Date in the interpretation or administration
thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged
with the interpretation or administration thereof, or actual compliance by such
Bank with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not
having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable
agency, has or would have the effect of increasing the costs to such Bank to a
level above that, or reducing the rate of return on such Bank's capital or
assets as a consequence of its commitments or obligations hereunder to a level
below that, which such Bank could have achieved but for such adoption,
effectiveness, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Bank's
policies with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time, upon written
demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower
shall, subject to the provisions of Section 1.14 (to the extent applicable), pay
to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank for
such increased costs or reduction.  Each Bank, upon determining that any
additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section 1.10(c), will give
prompt written notice thereof to the Borrower, which notice shall set forth the
basis of the calculation of such additional amounts, although the failure to
give any such notice shall not release or diminish the Borrower's obligations to
pay additional amounts pursuant to this Section 1.10(c) upon receipt of such
notice.

          (d)  In the event that any Bank shall determine (which determination
shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all parties
hereto) at any time that by reason of Regulation D such Bank is required to
maintain reserves in respect of Eurocurrency loans or liabilities during any
period that it has a Eurodollar Loan outstanding,

                                      -11-
<PAGE>
 
then such Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
by written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing)
specifying the additional amounts required to indemnify such Bank against the
cost of maintaining such reserves (such written notice to provide a computation
of such additional amounts) and the Borrower shall, subject to the provisions of
Section 1.14 (to the extent applicable), directly pay to such Bank such
specified amounts as additional interest at the time that it is otherwise
required to pay interest in respect of such Eurodollar Loan or, if later, on
demand.

          1.11  Compensation.  The Borrower shall, subject to the provisions of
                ------------                                                   
Section 1.14 (to the extent applicable), compensate each Bank, upon its written
request (which request shall set forth the basis for requesting such
compensation), for all reasonable losses, expenses and liabilities (including,
without limitation, any loss, expense or liability incurred by reason of the
liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds required by such Bank to
fund its Eurodollar Loans to the Borrower) which such Bank may sustain:

          (i)  if for any reason (other than a default or error by such Bank or
     the Administrative Agent) a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans does not occur
     on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or Notice of
     Conversion (whether or not withdrawn by the Borrower or deemed withdrawn
     pursuant to Section 1.10(a));

         (ii)  if any repayment or conversion of any of its Eurodollar Loans
     occurs on a date which is not the last day of an Interest Period applicable
     thereto;

        (iii)  if any prepayment of any of its Eurodollar Loans is not made on
     any date specified in a notice of prepayment given by the Borrower; or

         (iv)  as a consequence of (x) any other default by the Borrower to
     repay its Eurodollar Loans when required by the terms of this Agreement or
     (y) an election made pursuant to Section 1.10(b).

Calculation of all amounts payable to a Bank with respect to Eurodollar Loans
under this Section 1.11 shall be made as though that Bank had actually funded
its relevant Eurodollar Loan through the purchase of a Eurodollar deposit
bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate in an amount equal to the amount of that
Eurodollar Loan, having a maturity comparable to the relevant Interest Period
and through the transfer of

                                      -12-
<PAGE>
 
such Eurodollar deposit from an offshore office of that Bank to a domestic
office of that Bank in the United States of America (or if such Bank has no
offshore office, from an offshore office of the Administrative Agent to the
domestic office of the Administrative Agent); provided, however, that each Bank
                                              --------  -------                
may fund each of its Eurodollar Loans in any manner it sees fit and the
foregoing assumption shall be utilized only for the calculation of amounts
payable under this Section 1.11.

          1.12  Change of Lending Office.  Each Bank agrees that, upon the
                ------------------------                                  
occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 1.10(a)(ii) or
(iii), 1.10(c), 1.10(d), 2.05 or 4.04 with respect to such Bank, it will, if
requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy
considerations of such Bank) to designate another lending office of such Bank
for any Loans or Letters of Credit affected by such event, provided that such
                                                           --------          
designation is made on such terms that such Bank or its respective lending
offices suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, with the object
of avoiding the consequence of the event giving rise to the operation of any
such Section.  Nothing in this Section 1.12 shall affect or postpone any of the
obligations of the Borrower or the right of any Bank provided in Section 1.10,
2.05 or 4.04.

          1.13  Replacement of Banks.  (x)  Upon the occurrence of any event
                --------------------                                         
giving rise to the operation of Section 1.10(a)(ii) or (iii), Section 1.10(c),
Section 1.10(d), Section 2.05 or Section 4.04 with respect to any Bank which
results in such Bank charging to the Borrower increased costs which are material
in amount and are in excess of those being generally charged by the other Banks
or (y) as provided in Section 12.12(b) in the case of certain refusals by a Bank
to consent to certain proposed changes, waivers, discharges or terminations with
respect to this Agreement which have been approved by the Required Banks, the
Borrower shall have the right, if no Default or Event of Default then exists or
will exist immediately after giving effect to the respective replacement and, in
the case of a Bank described in clause (x) above, such Bank has not withdrawn
its request for such compensation or changed its applicable lending office with
the effect of eliminating or substantially decreasing (to a level which is not
material) such increased cost, to replace such Bank (the "Replaced Bank") with
one or more other Eligible Assignee or Assignees (collectively, the
"Replacement Bank") reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and, if
the Revolving Commitment of any Replaced Bank is to be replaced with a Revolving
Commitment provided by the

                                      -13-
<PAGE>
 
Replacement Bank, reasonably acceptable to each Letter of Credit Issuer;
provided that (i) at the time of any replacement pursuant to this Section 1.13,
- - - --------                                                                       
the Replacement Bank shall enter into one or more Assignment Agreements pursuant
to Section 12.04(b) (and with all fees payable pursuant to said Section 12.04(b)
to be paid by the Replacement Bank) pursuant to which the Replacement Bank shall
acquire all of the Commitments and outstanding Loans of, and participations in
Letters of Credit by, the Replaced Bank and, in connection therewith, shall pay
to (x) the Replaced Bank in respect thereof an amount equal to the sum of (A) an
amount equal to the principal of, and all accrued interest on, all outstanding
Loans of the Replaced Bank, (B) an amount equal to all Unpaid Drawings that have
been funded by (and not reimbursed to) such Replaced Bank, together with all
then unpaid interest with respect thereto at such time and (C) an amount equal
to all accrued, but theretofore unpaid, Fees owing to the Replaced Bank pursuant
to Section 3.01 and (y) the respective Letter of Credit Issuer an amount equal
to such Replaced Bank's Percentage (for this purpose, determined as if the
adjustment described in clause (y) of the immediately succeeding sentence had
been made with respect to such Replaced Bank) of any Unpaid Drawing (which at
such time remains an Unpaid Drawing) with respect to any Letter of Credit issued
by such Letter of Credit Issuer to the extent such amount was not theretofore
funded by such Replaced Bank, and (ii) all obligations of the Borrower owing to
the Replaced Bank (other than those specifically described in clause (i) above
in respect of which the assignment purchase price has been, or is concurrently
being, paid) shall be paid in full to such Replaced Bank concurrently with such
replacement.  Upon the execution of the respective Assignment Agreements, the
payment of amounts referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) above and, if so
requested by the Replacement Bank, delivery to the Replacement Bank of the
appropriate Note or Notes executed by the Borrower, (x) the Replacement Bank
shall become a Bank hereunder and the Replaced Bank shall cease to constitute a
Bank hereunder, except with respect to indemnification provisions under this
Agreement (including, without limitation, Sections 1.10, 1.11, 2.05, 4.04 and,
12.01), which shall survive as to such Replaced Bank and (y) the Percentages of
the Banks shall be automatically adjusted at such time to give effect to such
replacement.

          1.14  Limitation on Additional Amounts, etc.  Notwithstanding
                --------------------------------------                  
anything to the contrary contained in Sections 1.10, 1.11, 2.05 or 4.04 of this
Agreement, unless a Bank gives notice to the Borrower that it is obligated to
pay an

                                      -14-
<PAGE>
 
amount under any such respective Section within 120 days after the later of (x)
the date the Bank incurs the respective increased costs, taxes, loss, expense
or liability, reduction in amounts received or receivable or reduction in return
on capital or (y) the date such Bank has actual knowledge of its incurrence of
the respective increased costs, taxes, loss, expense or liability, reductions in
amounts received or receivable or reduction in return on capital, then such Bank
shall only be entitled to be compensated for such amount by the Borrower
pursuant to said Section 1.10, 1.11, 2.05 or 4.04, as the case may be, to the
extent the costs, taxes, loss, expense or liability, reduction in amounts
received or receivable or reduction in return on capital are incurred or
suffered on or after the date which occurs 120 days prior to such Bank giving
notice to the Borrower that it is obligated to pay the respective amounts
pursuant to said Section 1.10, 1.11, 2.05 or 4.04, as the case may be.  Each
Bank, in determining additional amounts owing under Sections 1.10, 1.11, 2.05 or
4.04, will act reasonably and in good faith, provided that such Bank's deter-
                                             --------                       
mination of such additional amounts so owing shall, absent manifest error, be
final and conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.  This Section 1.14 shall
have no applicability to any Section of this Agreement other than said Sections
1.10, 1.11, 2.05 and 4.04.

          SECTION 2.  Letters of Credit.
                      ----------------- 

          2.01  Letters of Credit.  (a)  Subject to and upon the terms and
                -----------------                                         
conditions herein set forth, the Borrower may request a Letter of Credit Issuer
at any time and from time to time on or after the Initial Borrowing Date and
prior to the Revolving Credit Facility Maturity Date to issue, and subject to
the terms and conditions herein set forth, such Letter of Credit Issuer hereby
agrees to issue from time to time, (x) for the account of the Borrower on a
standby basis and in support of insurance obligations, workers compensation or
bonding obligations in respect of taxes, licenses and similar requirements, in
each case of the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or any Permitted Joint
Venture, and other obligations (as specified in the respective Letter of Credit
Request and consented to by the Administrative Agent and the respective Letter
of Credit Issuer) of the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries and/or any Permitted
Joint Venture, an irrevocable standby letter of credit so requested by the
Borrower in a form customarily used by such Letter of Credit Issuer or in such
other form as may be approved by such Letter of Credit Issuer and the
Administrative Agent (each such standby letter of credit, a "Standby Letter of
Credit" and collec-

                                      -15-
<PAGE>
 
tively, the "Standby Letters of Credit"), and (y) for the account of the
Borrower and for the benefit of sellers of goods to the Borrower, any of its
Subsidiaries or any Permitted Joint Venture, an irrevocable documentary letter
of credit in a form customarily used by such Letter of Credit Issuer or in such
other form as may be approved by such Letter of Credit Issuer and the
Administrative Agent in support of commercial transactions of the Borrower, any
of its Subsidiaries or any Permitted Joint Venture, as the case may be, entered
into in the ordinary course of its business (each such documentary letter of
credit, a "Trade Letter of Credit" and collectively, the "Trade Letters of
Credit" and together with the Standby Letters of Credit, the "Letters of
Credit").  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Letter of Credit Issuer shall be
obligated to issue any Letter of Credit at a time when a Bank Default exists
unless such Letter of Credit Issuer has entered into arrangements satisfactory
to it and the Borrower to eliminate such Letter of Credit Issuer's risk with
respect to the participation in Letters of Credit of the Bank which is the
subject of the Bank Default, including by cash collateralizing such Bank's
Percentage of the Letter of Credit Outstandings.

          (b)  Schedule IV hereto contains a description of all letters of
credit issued by PNC prior to the Initial Borrowing Date in support of
obligations of the Borrower and/or its Subsidiaries and which remain outstanding
on the Initial Borrowing Date.  Each such letter of credit, including any
extension thereof, issued by PNC and listed on such Schedule IV (each an
"Existing Letter of Credit") shall remain outstanding on and after the Initial
Borrowing Date and constitute a "Letter of Credit" for all purposes of this
Agreement, and shall be deemed issued for purposes of Section 2.02(a) on the
Initial Borrowing Date.

          (c)  Notwithstanding the foregoing,

             (i)  no Letter of Credit shall be issued the Stated Amount of
     which, when added to the Letter of Credit Outstandings at such time, would
     exceed either (x) $30,000,000, or (y) when added to the aggregate princi-
     pal amount of all Revolving Loans then outstanding, the lesser of (A) the
     Total Revolving Commitment at such time and (B) the Borrowing Base at such
     time;

             (ii)  each Letter of Credit shall by its terms terminate on or
     before the earlier of (x)(A) in the case of Standby Letters of Credit, the
     date which occurs 18 months after such Standby Letter of Credit's date of

                                      -16-
<PAGE>
 
     issuance (subject to extension provisions acceptable to the Administrative
     Agent and the respective Letter of Credit Issuer) and (B) in the case of
     Trade Letters of Credit, the date which occurs 180 days after such Trade
     Letter of Credit's date of issuance and (y) the third Business Day
     preceding the Revolving Credit Facility Maturity Date;

             (iii)  each Standby Letter of Credit shall be denominated in
     Dollars;

             (iv)  each Trade Letter of Credit shall be denominated in Dollars
     or an Approved Alternate Currency, provided that no Trade Letter of Credit
                                        --------                               
     denominated in an Approved Alternate Currency shall be issued by any Letter
     of Credit Issuer if the Stated Amount of such Trade Letter of Credit, when
     added to the Letter of Credit Outstandings at such time in respect of Trade
     Letters of Credit denominated in Approved Alternate Currencies, would
     exceed $5,000,000;

             (v)  no Standby Letter of Credit shall have a Stated Amount of less
     than $100,000 unless otherwise agreed to by the respective Letter of Credit
     Issuer;

             (vi)  no Trade Letter of Credit shall have a Stated Amount of less
     than $10,000 unless otherwise agreed to by the respective Letter of Credit
     Issuer;

             (vii)  no Letter of Credit shall be issued by any Letter of Credit
     Issuer after it has received a written notice from the Borrower, the
     Administrative Agent or the Required Banks stating that a Default or Event
     of Default has occurred and is continuing until such time as such Letter of
     Credit Issuer shall have received a written notice of (x) rescission of
     such notice from the party or parties originally delivering such notice or
     (y) the waiver of such Default or Event of Default by the Required Banks;
     and

             (viii)  no Letter of Credit shall be issued in support of any
     obligation of any Permitted Joint Venture the Stated Amount of which, when
     added to the sum of (x) the Joint Venture Letter of Credit Outstandings at
     such time and (y) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Joint
     Venture Investments, would exceed $30,000,000.

In connection with the issuance of any Letter of Credit, the respective Letter
of Credit Issuer may request from the

                                      -17-
<PAGE>
 
Administrative Agent (x) a determination in accordance with Section
12.07(c)(y) as to the Stated Amount of any Letter of Credit and of the
principal amount of Unpaid Drawings, in each case to the extent denominated in
a currency other than Dollars, (y) the Letter of Credit Outstandings at such 
time with respect to Letters of Credit issued by all other Letter of Credit 
Issuers and (z) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Revolving Loans 
at such time, and such Letter of Credit Issuer shall be
entitled to rely on such information provided by the Administrative Agent.

          2.02  Letter of Credit Participations.  (a)  Immediately upon the
                -------------------------------                             
issuance by a Letter of Credit Issuer of any Letter of Credit, the respective
Letter of Credit Issuer shall be deemed to have sold and transferred to each
other Bank with a Revolving Commitment (each such other Bank, in its capacity
under this Section 2.02, a "Participating Bank"), and each such Participating
Bank shall be deemed irrevocably and unconditionally to have purchased and re-
ceived from such Letter of Credit Issuer, without recourse or warranty, an
undivided interest and participation, to the extent of such Participating Bank's
Percentage, in such Letter of Credit, each substitute letter of credit, each
drawing made thereunder and the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement
with respect thereto, and any security therefor or guaranty pertaining thereto
(although L/C Fees will be paid directly to the Administrative Agent for the
ratable account of the Participating Banks as provided in Section 3.01(b) and
the Participating Banks shall have no right to receive any portion of any L/C
Facing Fees).  Upon any change in the Revolving Commitments of the Banks
pursuant to Section 12.04, it is hereby agreed that, with respect to all
outstanding Letters of Credit and Unpaid Drawings, there shall be an automatic
adjustment to the participations pursuant to this Section 2.02 to reflect the
new Percentages of the assignor and assignee Banks.

          (b)  In determining whether to pay under any Letter of Credit, the
respective Letter of Credit Issuer issuing same shall have no obligation
relative to any other Bank other than to confirm that any documents required to
be delivered under such Letter of Credit have been delivered and that they
appear to comply on their face with the requirements of such Letter of Credit.
Any action taken or omitted to be taken by a Letter of Credit Issuer under or in
connection with any Letter of Credit issued by it if taken or omitted in the
absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall not create for such
Letter of Credit Issuer any resulting liability to the Borrower or any Bank.

          (c)  In the event that a Letter of Credit Issuer makes any payment
under any Letter of Credit issued by it and

                                      -18-
<PAGE>
 
the Borrower shall not have reimbursed such amount in full to such Letter of
Credit Issuer pursuant to Section 2.04(a), such Letter of Credit Issuer shall
promptly notify the Administrative Agent and after receipt of such notice, the
Administrative Agent will notify each Participating Bank of such failure, and
each Participating Bank shall promptly and unconditionally pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Letter of Credit Issuer, the amount
of such Participating Bank's Percentage of such unreimbursed payment in lawful
money of the United States of America and in same day funds; provided, however,
                                                             --------  ------- 
that no Participating Bank shall be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent
for the account of such Letter of Credit Issuer its Percentage of such
unreimbursed amount for any wrongful payment made by such Letter of Credit
Issuer under a Letter of Credit as a result of acts or omissions constituting
willful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of such Letter of Credit
Issuer.  If the Administrative Agent so notifies, prior to 11:00 A.M. (New York
time) on any Business Day, any Participating Bank required to fund a payment
under a Letter of Credit, such Participating Bank shall make available to the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Letter of Credit Issuer such
Participating Bank's Percentage of the amount of such payment on such Business
Day in same day funds.  If and to the extent such Participating Bank shall not
have so made its Percentage of the amount of such payment available to the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Letter of Credit Issuer, such
Participating Bank agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of
such Letter of Credit Issuer, forthwith on demand, such amount, together with
interest thereon, for each day from such date until the date such amount is paid
to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Letter of Credit Issuer at
the overnight Federal Funds Rate.  The failure of any Participating Bank to make
available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the respective Letter
of Credit Issuer its Percentage of any payment under any Letter of Credit shall
not relieve any other Participating Bank of its obligation hereunder to make
available to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Letter of Credit
Issuer its Percentage of any payment under any Letter of Credit on the date
required, as specified above, but no Participating Bank shall be responsible for
the failure of any other Participating Bank to make available to the
Administrative Agent, such other Participating Bank's Percentage of any such
payment.

          (d)  Whenever a Letter of Credit Issuer receives a payment of a
reimbursement obligation as to which the Administrative Agent has received for
the account of such

                                      -19-
<PAGE>
 
Letter of Credit Issuer any payments from the Participating Banks pursuant to
clause (c) above, such Letter of Credit Issuer shall pay to the Administrative
Agent and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to each Participating
Bank which has paid its Percentage thereof, in Dollars and in same day funds, an
amount equal to such Participating Bank's share (based upon the proportionate
aggregate amount originally funded by such Participating Bank to the aggregate
amount funded by all Participating Banks) of the principal amount of such
reimbursement and of interest reimbursed thereon accruing from and after the
date of the purchase of the respective participations.

          (e)  The obligations of the Participating Banks to make payments to
the Administrative Agent for the account of any Letter of Credit Issuer with
respect to Letters of Credit shall be irrevocable and not subject to
counterclaim, set-off or other defense or any other qualification or exception
whatsoever and shall be made in accordance with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement under all circumstances, including, without limitation, any of
the following circumstances:

             (i)  any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement or
     any of the other Credit Documents;

             (ii)  the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right
     which the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or any Permitted Joint Venture
     may have at any time against a beneficiary named in a Letter of Credit, any
     transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such
     transferee may be acting), the Administrative Agent, any Co-Agent, any
     Letter of Credit Issuer, any Bank, or any other Person, whether in con-
     nection with this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, the transactions
     contemplated herein (including the Transaction) or any unrelated
     transactions (including any underlying transaction between the Borrower,
     any of its Subsidiaries or any Permitted Joint Venture and the beneficiary
     named in any such Letter of Credit);

             (iii)  any draft, certificate or any other document presented under
     any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or
     insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
     inaccurate in any respect;

             (iv)  the surrender or impairment of any security for the
     performance or observance of any of the terms of any of the Credit
     Documents; or

                                      -20-
<PAGE>
 
     (v) the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default.

          2.03  Letter of Credit Requests; Notices of Issuance.  (a)  Whenever
                -----------------------------------------------                
it desires that a Letter of Credit be issued, the Borrower shall give the
Administrative Agent and the respective Letter of Credit Issuer written notice
(including by way of telecopier) thereof prior to 1:00 P.M. (New York time) at
least three Business Days (or such shorter period as may be acceptable to such
Letter of Credit Issuer) prior to the proposed date (which shall be a Business
Day) of issuance (each a "Letter of Credit Request"), which Letter of Credit
Request shall include an application for the Letter of Credit and any other
documents that such Letter of Credit Issuer customarily requires in connection
therewith.  The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank with a
Revolving Commitment of each Letter of Credit Request.

          (b)  The delivery of each Letter of Credit Request shall be deemed a
representation and warranty by the Borrower that such Letter of Credit as
requested in such Letter of Credit Request may be issued in accordance with and
will not violate the requirements of Section 2.01(c).  Each Letter of Credit
Issuer shall, on the date of each issuance of a Letter of Credit by it, give the
Administrative Agent, each Bank with a Revolving Commitment and the Borrower
written notice of the issuance of such Letter of Credit, accompanied by a copy
to the Administrative Agent of the Letter of Credit or Letters of Credit issued
by it.

          2.04  Agreement to Repay Letter of Credit Drawings.  (a)  The Borrower
                --------------------------------------------                    
hereby agrees to reimburse each respective Letter of Credit Issuer, by making
payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Letter of Credit
Issuer in Dollars in immediately available funds at the Payment Office, for any
payment or disbursement made by such Letter of Credit Issuer under any Letter of
Credit issued by it (each such amount so paid or disbursed until reimbursed, an
"Unpaid Drawing") immediately after, and in any event on the date of, notice
from such Letter of Credit Issuer of such payment or disbursement with interest
on the amount so paid or disbursed by such Letter of Credit Issuer, to the
extent not reimbursed prior to 1:00 P.M. (New York time) on the date of such
payment or disbursement, from and including the date paid or disbursed to but
not including the date such Letter of Credit Issuer is reimbursed therefor at a
rate per annum which shall be the Applicable Base Rate Margin plus the Base Rate
as in effect from time to time (plus an additional 2% per annum if not
reimbursed by the third Business Day after the date of

                                      -21-
<PAGE>
 
notice of such payment or disbursement), such interest to be payable on demand.

          (b)  The Borrower's obligation under this Section 2.04 to reimburse
each respective Letter of Credit Issuer with respect to Unpaid Drawings
(including, in each case, interest thereon) shall be absolute and unconditional
under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or
defense to payment which the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or any Permitted
Joint Venture may have or have had against such Letter of Credit Issuer, the
Administrative Agent, any Co-Agent or any Bank, including, without limitation,
any defense based upon the failure of any drawing under a Letter of Credit to
conform to the terms of the Letter of Credit or any non-application or
misapplication by the beneficiary of the proceeds of such drawing or any
amendment or waiver or any consent to or departure from a Letter of Credit or
any other circumstance whatsoever in making or failing to make payment under a
Letter of Credit; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be obligated to
                  --------  -------                                             
reimburse a Letter of Credit Issuer for any wrongful payment made by such Letter
of Credit Issuer under a Letter of Credit as a result of acts or omissions
constituting willful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of such Letter
of Credit Issuer.

          2.05  Increased Costs.  If at any time after the Effective Date, the
                ---------------                                               
adoption or effectiveness of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any
change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by
any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or actual compliance by any Letter of
Credit Issuer or any Participating Bank with any request or directive (whether
or not having the force of law) by any such authority, central bank or
comparable agency shall either (i) impose, modify or make applicable any
reserve, deposit, capital adequacy or similar

                                      -22-

requirement against Letters of Credit issued by any Letter of Credit Issuer or
any Participating Bank's participation therein, or (ii) impose on any Letter of
Credit Issuer or any Participating Bank any other conditions affecting this
Agreement, any Letter of Credit or any Participating Bank's participation
therein; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to any
such Letter of Credit Issuer or any such Participating Bank of issuing,
maintaining or participating in any Letter of Credit, or to reduce the amount of
any sum received or receivable by any such Letter of Credit Issuer or such
Participating Bank hereunder, then, upon demand to the Borrower by such Letter
of Credit Issuer or such Participating Bank (a copy of which notice shall be
sent by such Letter of Credit Issuer or such Participating Bank to the
Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall, subject to Section 1.14 (to the
extent applicable), pay to such Letter of Credit Issuer or such Participating
Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Letter of Credit
Issuer or such Participating Bank for such increased costs or reduction.  A
certificate shall be submitted to the Borrower by a Letter of Credit Issuer or
such Participating Bank, as the case may be (a copy of which certificate shall

than 1:00 P.M. (New York time) shall be deemed to have been made on the next
succeeding Business Day.  Whenever any payment to be made hereunder shall be
stated to be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the due date thereof
shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, with respect to pay-
ments of principal, interest shall be payable during such extension at the

                ------------                                                    
under any Note or under any other Credit Document will be made without setoff,
counterclaim or other defense.  Except as provided for in Section 4.04(b), all
such payments will be made free and clear of, and without deduction or
withholding for, any present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees,
assessments or other charges of whatever nature now or hereafter imposed by any
jurisdiction or by any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or
therein (but excluding, except as provided in the second succeeding sentence,
any tax imposed on or measured by the net income of a Bank pursuant to the laws
of the jurisdiction in which the principal office or applicable lending office
of such Bank is located or under the laws of any political subdivision or taxing
authority of any such jurisdiction in which the principal office or applicable
lending office of such Bank is located) and all interest, penalties or similar
liabilities with respect thereto (collectively, "Taxes").  If any Taxes are so
levied or imposed, the Borrower agrees to pay the full amount of such Taxes, and
such additional amounts as may be necessary so that every payment of all amounts
due hereunder, under any Note or under any other Credit Document, after
withholding or deduction for or on account of any Taxes, will not be less than
the amount provided for herein, in such Note or in such other Credit Document.
If any amounts are payable in respect of Taxes pursuant to the preceding
sentence, then the Borrower agrees to reimburse each Bank, upon the written
request of such Bank, for taxes imposed on or measured by the net income of such
Bank pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in which the principal office or
applicable lending office of such Bank is located or under the laws of any
political subdivision or taxing authority of any such jurisdiction in which the
principal office or applicable lending office of such Bank is located and for
any withholding of income or similar taxes imposed by the United States of
America as such Bank

                                      -31-
<PAGE>
 
shall determine are payable by, or withheld from, such Bank in respect of such
amounts so paid to or on behalf of such Bank pursuant to the preceding sentence
and in respect of any amounts paid to or on behalf of such Bank pursuant to this
sentence.  The Borrower will furnish to the Administrative Agent within 45 days
after the date the payment of any Taxes, or any withholding or deduction on
account thereof, is due pursuant to applicable law, certified copies of tax
receipts evidencing such payment by the Borrower.  The Borrower will indemnify
and hold harmless the Administrative Agent, each Co-Agent and each Bank, and
reimburse the Administrative Agent, such Co-Agent or such Bank upon its written
request, for the amount of any Taxes so levied or imposed and paid or withheld
by the Administrative Agent, such Co-Agent or such Bank.

          (b)  Each Bank which is not a United States person (as such term is
defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. Federal income tax purposes
agrees (i) to provide to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior
to the Initial Borrowing Date two original signed copies of Internal Revenue
Service Form 4224 or Form 1001 certifying to such Bank's entitlement to an
exemption from United States withholding tax with respect to payments to be
made under this Agreement and under any Note and (ii) that, to the extent
legally entitled to do so, (x) with respect to a Bank that is an assignee or
transferee of an interest under this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.04(b)(y)
(unless the respective Bank was already a Bank hereunder immediately prior to
such assignment or transfer), upon the date of such assignment or transfer to
such Bank, and (y) with respect to any Bank which is not a United States person
(as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. Federal
income tax purposes (including, without limitation, any assignee or transferee),
from time to time, upon the reasonable request by the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent after the Initial Borrowing Date, such Bank will provide to
each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two original signed copies of
Internal Revenue Service Form 4224 or Form 1001 (or any successor forms)
certifying to such Bank's entitlement to an exemption from United States
withholding tax with respect to payments to be made under this Agreement and
under any Note.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section
4.04(a), but subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, the Borrower shall
be entitled, to the extent it is required to do so by law, to deduct or withhold
income or other similar taxes imposed by the United States (or any political
subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein) from interest, fees or other
amounts payable hereunder (without

                                      -32-

any obligation to pay the respective Bank additional amounts with respect
thereto) for the account of any Bank which is not a United States person (as
such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. Federal
income tax purposes and which has not provided to the Borrower such forms
required to be provided to the Borrower by a Bank pursuant to the first
sentence of this Section 4.04(b); provided that if the Borrower shall so deduct
                                  --------                                     
or withhold any such taxes, it shall provide a statement to the Administrative
Agent and such Bank, setting forth the amount of such taxes so deducted or
withheld, the applicable rate and any other information or documentation which
such Bank may reasonably request for assisting such Bank in obtaining any
allowable credits or deductions for the taxes so deducted or withheld in the
jurisdiction or jurisdictions in which such Bank is subject to tax.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the preceding sentence and
except as set forth in Section 12.04(b), the Borrower agrees to indemnify each
Bank in the manner set forth in Section 4.04(a) in respect of any amounts
deducted or withheld by it as described in the previous sentence as a result of
any changes after the Effective Date in any applicable law, treaty, governmental
rule, regulation, guideline or order, or in the interpretation thereof,
relating to the deducting or withholding of income or similar Taxes.

material respects on the date as of which such information is dated or certified
and not incomplete by omitting to state any material fact necessary to make such
information (taken as a whole) not misleading at such time in light of the

not have incurred nor intended to, nor believes that it or they will, incur
debts beyond its or their ability to pay such debts as such debts mature and (z)
it and they will have sufficient capital with which to conduct its or their

except to the extent provided in the notes to said financial statements.

          (c)  Except for the Transaction and the other matters disclosed in the
Press Release, nothing has occurred since December 31, 1993, that has had or

and whether or not due), and the Borrower does not know of any basis for the
assertion against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of any such liability
or obligation, which has or could be reasonably expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

"Projections") set forth in Schedule V hereto and previously delivered to the
Administrative Agent and the Banks have been prepared on a basis consistent with
the financial statements referred to in Section 6.11(b) (other than as set forth
or presented in such Projections), and there are no statements or conclusions in
any of the Projections which are based upon or include information known to the
Borrower to be misleading in any material respect or which fail to take into
account material information regarding the matters reported therein.  On the
Initial Borrowing Date, the Borrower believes that the Projections are reason-
able and attainable subject, however, to the qualifications concerning the
Projections noted in the penultimate sentence of Section 6.09.

to the Permitted Encumbrances related thereto) and subject to no other Liens
(other than Liens permitted under Section 8.02).  Each Credit Party has good and
legal title or a valid leasehold interest, as the case may be, to the Mortgaged
Properties owned or leased by such Credit Party, free and clear of all Liens
except those described in the first sentence of this subsection (c).

multiemployer plan as defined in section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a "Multiemployer
Plan")) currently maintained or contributed to by (or to which there is an
obligation to contribute of) any Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries or any
ERISA Affiliate is in material compliance with ERISA and the Code; no Reportable
Event has occurred with respect to

                                      -49-

any such Plan; as of December 31, 1993, no such Plan has an Unfunded Current
Liability in excess of $6,000,000 individually and with respect to all such
Plans in the aggregate, in excess of $15,000,000; no such Plan has an Unfunded
Current Liability which either individually or when added to the aggregate
amount of Unfunded Current Liabilities with respect to all other Plans, has or
could be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; no such Plan has
an accumulated or waived funding deficiency or permitted decreases in its
funding standard account or has applied for an extension of any amortization
period within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code; all contributions required
to be made with respect to any Plan currently maintained or contributed to by
(or to which there is an obligation to contribute of) any Credit Party or any of
its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate and any Foreign Pension Plan have been
timely made; neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their
ERISA Affiliates has incurred any material liability to or on account of a Plan
pursuant to Section 409, 502(i), 502(l), 4062, 4063, 4064 or 4069 of ERISA or
Section 401(a)(29), 4971 or 4975 of the Code, or expects to incur any liability
(including any indirect, contingent, or secondary liability) under any of the
foregoing Sections with respect to any Plan; no proceedings have been instituted
to terminate or appoint a trustee to administer any such Plan; no condition
exists which presents a material risk to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
or any of their ERISA Affiliates of incurring such a material liability to or on
account of any Plan pursuant to the foregoing provisions of ERISA and the Code;
as of the Initial Borrowing Date, no Plan is a Multiemployer Plan; neither the
Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any
liability under Section 515 of ERISA with respect to any Multiemployer Plan;
neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliate has
incurred or expects to incur any material liability under Sections 4201, 4204 or
4212 of ERISA; to the best knowledge of the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or
any ERISA Affiliate, no Multiemployer Plan is insolvent or in reorganization nor
is any Multiemployer Plan reasonably expected to be in reorganization or
terminated; no lien imposed under the Code or ERISA on the assets of the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate exists or is likely
to arise on account of any Plan; and the Borrower and its Subsidiaries do not
maintain or contribute to any employee welfare benefit plan (as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA) which provides benefits to retired employees or other
former employees (other than as required by Section 601 of ERISA) or any
employee pension benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) the obli-

                                      -50-

gations with respect to which could reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the ability of the Borrower to perform its obligations under
this Agreement.

          (b)  Each Foreign Pension Plan has been maintained in substantial
compliance with its terms and with the requirements of any and all applicable
laws, statutes, rules, regulations and orders and has been maintained, where re-
quired, in good standing with applicable regulatory authorities.  Neither the
Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any material obligation in
connection with the termination of or withdrawal from any Foreign Pension Plan.
The present value of the accrued benefit liabilities (whether or not vested)
under each Foreign Pension Plan, determined as of the end of the Borrower's most
recently  ended fiscal year on the basis of actuarial assumptions, each of which
is reasonable, did not exceed the current value of the assets of such Foreign
Pension Plan allocable to such benefit liabilities.

          6.15  Subsidiaries.  Schedule VI hereto lists each Subsidiary of the
                ------------                                                  
Borrower, and the direct and indirect ownership interest of the Borrower
therein, in each case as of the Initial Borrowing Date.  On the Initial
Borrowing Date, the corporations listed on Schedule VI are the only Subsidi-
aries of the Borrower.

          6.16  Patents, etc.  The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries owns or
                -------------                                                   
holds a valid license to use all material patents, trademarks, servicemarks,
trade names, copyrights, licenses, technology, know-how and formulas and other
rights that are necessary for the operation of their respective businesses as
presently conducted.

          6.17  Compliance with Statutes; Environmental Matters, etc.  (a)  Each
                -----------------------------------------------------           
Credit Party is in compliance, in all material respects, with all applicable
material statutes, regulations and orders of, and all applicable material res-
trictions imposed by, all governmental bodies, domestic or foreign, in respect
of the conduct of its business and the ownership of its property (including
applicable Environmental Laws).

          (b)  No Credit Party is liable for any material penalties, fines or
forfeitures for failure to comply with any of the foregoing referenced in clause
(a) above.  All material licenses, permits, registrations or approvals required
for the business of any Credit Party, as conducted as of the Initial Borrowing
Date, under any Environmental Law have been secured or have been timely applied
for and each

                                      -51-

Credit Party is in substantial compliance therewith.  No Credit Party is in any
material respect in noncompliance with, breach of or default under any
applicable writ, order, judgment, injunction, or decree to which such Credit
Party is a party or which would affect the ability of such Credit Party to
operate any Real Property and no event has occurred and is continuing which,
with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both, would constitute a
material noncompliance, breach of or default thereunder.  As of the Initial
Borrowing Date there are no material Environmental Claims pending or, to the
best knowledge after due inquiry of the Borrower, threatened, against the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any Real Property owned or operated at
any time by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.  There are no facts,
circumstances, conditions or occurrences on any such Real Property or, to the
best knowledge after due inquiry of the Borrower, on any property adjacent to
any such Real Property that could reasonably be expected (i) to form the basis
of a material Environmental Claim against the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries or any such Real Property, or (ii) to cause such Real Property to
be subject to any restrictions on the ownership, occupancy, use or trans-
ferability of such Real Property under any Environmental Law.

          (c)  Hazardous Materials have not at any time been (i) generated,
used, treated or stored on, or transported to or from, any Real Property owned
or operated by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries except for quantities
used or stored at any such Real Properties in material compliance with all
applicable Environmental Laws and required in connection with the normal
operation, use and maintenance of such Real Property ("Permitted Materials") or
(ii) Released on any such Real Property where such occurrence or event could
reasonably be expected to give rise to a material Environmental Claim or to
violate any Environmental Law.  There are not now and never have been any
underground storage tanks located on any Real Property owned or operated by the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which are not in compliance with all
Environmental Laws.

          6.18  Properties.  Each Credit Party has good and legal title to all
                ----------                                                    
properties owned by it and valid and subsisting leasehold interests in all
properties leased by it, in each case, including all property reflected in the
financial statements referred to in Section 6.11(b) (except as sold or
otherwise disposed of since the date of the December 31, 1993 financial
statements in the ordinary course of business or as otherwise permitted by this
Agreement) free and clear of all Liens, other than Liens permitted by Section

any Credit Party and any union, labor organization or other bargaining agent in
respect of the employees of any Credit Party on the Effective Date.

          (b)  No Credit Party is engaged in any unfair labor practice that is
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.  There is (i) no unfair
labor practice complaint pending against any Credit Party or, to the best
knowledge of any Credit Party, threatened against it, before the National Labor
Relations Board, and no grievance proceeding or arbitration proceeding arising
out of or under any Collective Bargaining Agreement is now pending against any
Credit Party or, to the best knowledge of any Credit Party, threatened against
it, (ii) no strike, labor dispute, slowdown or stoppage is pending against any
Credit Party or, to the best knowledge of any Credit Party, threatened against
it and (iii) to the best knowledge of each Credit Party, no union representation
question exists with respect to the employees of such Credit Party, except
(with respect to any matter specified in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above, either
individually or in the aggregate) such as could not reasonably be likely to have
a Material Adverse Effect.

                ------------

(whether or not any condition to such incurrence could be met) (collectively, as
in effect and outstanding on the Initial Borrowing Date and without giving
effect to any extension, renewal or refinancing thereof, the "Permitted Existing
Indebtedness"), in each case showing the aggregate

appraisals satisfying the requirements set forth in 12 C.F.R., Part 34-Subpart
C, or any successor or similar statute, rule, regulation, guideline or order
(any such appraisal, a "Required Appraisal") are or were required to be

aggregate reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

of a guaranty in substantially the form of the Subsidiary Guaranty or (iii) the
entering into by such Foreign Subsidiary of a security agreement in
substantially the form of the Security Agreement, in any case would cause the
earnings of such Foreign Subsidiary to be treated as a deemed dividend to such

order or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct
and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon
advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel
to the Credit Parties), independent accountants and other experts selected by
the Administrative Agent and/or any such Co-Agent.  The Administrative Agent and
the Co-Agents each shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any

receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Banks as it deems appropriate
or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Banks against any
and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action.  The Administrative Agent and the Co-Agents
each shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from
acting, under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents in accordance with a
request of the Required Banks, and such request and any action taken or failure

Default or Event of Default hereunder unless it has received notice from a Bank

receives such a notice, it shall give prompt notice thereof to the Banks.  The
Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or
Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Banks, provided
                                                                        --------

        11.06  Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent, Co-Agents and Other Banks.
               ----------------------------------------------------------------
Each Bank expressly acknowledges that neither the Administrative Agent
nor any Co-Agent nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates have made any representations or
warranties to it and that no act by the

                                     -133-
<PAGE>
 
Administrative Agent or any Co-Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of
the affairs of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to
constitute any representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent or any
Co-Agent to any Bank.  Each Bank represents to the Administrative Agent and the
Co-Agents that it has, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any Co-Agent or any other Bank, and based on such
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal
of and investigation into the business, assets, operations, property, financial
and other conditions, prospects and creditworthiness of the Credit Parties and
made its own decision to make its Loans, and participate in Letters of Credit,
hereunder and enter into this Agreement.  Each Bank also represents that it
will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any
Co-Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it
shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis,
appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement,
and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the
business, assets, operations, property, financial and other conditions,
prospects and creditworthiness of the Credit Parties.  Neither the
Administrative Agent nor any Co-Agent shall have any duty or responsibility to
provide any Bank with any credit or other information concerning the business,

Administrative Agent and each Co-Agent in its capacity as such ratably according
to their respective "percentages" as used in determining the Required Banks at
such time (or if the Total Commitment has been terminated and all Loans have
been repaid, their respective "percentages" used in determining the Required
Banks immediately prior to such termination and repayment), from and against any
and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, reasonable expenses or disbursements of any kind
whatsoever which may at any time (including, without limitation, at any time
following the payment of the Obligations) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against the Administrative Agent or such Co-Agent in its capacity as such in any
way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Credit Document,
or any documents

                                     -134-
<PAGE>
 
contemplated by or referred to herein or the transactions contemplated hereby or
any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Administrative Agent or such Co-
Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing, but only to the extent
that any of the foregoing is not paid by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries, provided that no Bank shall be liable to the Administrative Agent
              --------                                                         
or any Co-Agent for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements resulting solely from the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of the Administrative Agent or such Co-Agent, as the case may be.  If any
indemnity furnished to the Administrative Agent or any Co-Agent for any purpose
shall, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent or such Co-Agent, be
insufficient or become impaired, the Administrative Agent or such Co-Agent may
call for additional indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the acts indem-
nified against until such additional indemnity is furnished.  The agreements in
this Section 11.07 shall survive the payment of all Obligations.

          11.08  Individual Capacity.  The Administrative Agent and each Co-
                 -------------------                                       
Agent and their respective affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from
and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any of its

Administrative Agent or a Co-Agent hereunder.  With respect to the Loans made by
it and all Obligations owing to it, the Administrative Agent and each Co-Agent
shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any Bank and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent or a Co-Agent
and the terms "Required Banks", "Bank" and "Banks" shall include the
Administrative Agent and each Co-Agent in its individual capacity.

          11.09  Resignation; Successors.  The Administrative Agent and/or each
                 -----------------------                                       
Co-Agent may resign as the Administrative Agent or a Co-Agent, as the case may
be, upon 20 days' notice to the Banks.  To the extent not prohibited by law, the
Administrative Agent shall send a copy of any such resignation notice to the
Borrower.  Upon the resignation of the Administrative Agent (including in its
capacity as a Co-Agent), the Required Banks shall appoint from among the Banks a
successor Administrative Agent for the Banks subject to prior approval by the
Borrower (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld), whereupon such
successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the
Administrative Agent, and the term "Administrative Agent"

                                     -135-
<PAGE>
 
shall include such successor agent effective upon its appointment, and the
resigning Administrative Agent's rights, powers and duties as the Administrative
Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part
of such former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement.
After the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder as the
Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 11 shall inure to its
benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
Administrative Agent under this Agreement.  In the event no successor
Administrative Agent has been appointed by the end of such 20 day period, the
resignation of the Administrative Agent shall become effective and the Required
Banks shall perform the duties of the Administrative Agent until a successor
Administrative Agent is appointed.

          11.10  Holders.  The Administrative Agent and the Co-Agents each may
                 -------                                                      
deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes
hereof unless and until a written notice of the assignment, transfer or
endorsement thereof, as the case may be, shall have been filed with the
Administrative Agent.  Any request, authority or consent of any Person or entity
who, at the time of making such request or giving such authority or consent, is
the holder of any Note shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder,
transferee, assignee or indorsee, as the case may be, or such Note or of any
Note or Notes issued in exchange thereof.

          SECTION 12.  Miscellaneous.
                       ------------- 

          12.01  Payment of Expenses, etc.  The Borrower agrees to: (i) whether
                 -------------------------

Agent's syndication efforts with respect to this Agreement; (ii) pay all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent and each
of the Banks in connection with the enforcement of the Credit Documents and the
documents and instruments referred to therein (including, without limitation,
the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent
and for each of the Banks); (iii)

                                     -136-
<PAGE>
 
pay and hold each of the Banks harmless from and against any and all present and
future stamp and other similar taxes with respect to the foregoing matters and
save each of the Banks harmless from and against any and all liabilities with
respect to or resulting from any delay or omission (other than to the extent
attributable to such Bank) to pay such taxes; and (iv) indemnify the
Administrative Agent, each Co-Agent and each Bank, their respective officers,
directors, employees, representatives and agents (each, an "indemnified
person") from and hold each of them harmless against any and all losses,
liabilities, claims, damages or expenses incurred by any of them as a result of,
or arising out of, or in any way related to, or by reason of, regardless of when
any such indemnified matter arises, (a) any investigation, litigation or other
proceeding (whether or not the Administrative Agent, any Co-Agent or any Bank is
a party thereto) related to the entering into and/or performance of any Document
or the use of the proceeds of any Loans or Letter of Credit hereunder or the
Refinancing or any other aspect of the Transaction or the consummation of any
other transactions contemplated in any Document, (b) any settlement entered into
in connection with the foregoing to the extent such settlement has been con-
sented to by the Borrower, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
(c) the actual or alleged presence, generation or Release of Hazardous Materials
on or from, or the transportation of Hazardous Materials to or from, any Real
Property owned or operated at any time by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries, the non-compliance of any such Real Property with foreign,
federal, state and local laws, regulations, and ordinances (including applicable
permits thereunder) applicable to any such Real Property, or any Environmental
Claim with respect to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any such Real
Property, in each case including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel and other consultants incurred in connection with any
such investigation, litigation, Environmental Claim or any of such Credit
Party's acts, omissions, business, operations or Real Property, or other
proceeding (but excluding any such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or
expenses to the extent incurred by reason of the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the indemnified person).  To the extent that the undertaking to
indemnify and hold harmless set forth in this Section 12.01 may be unenforceable
because it is violative of any law or public policy as determined by a final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, the Borrower shall make the
maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of each of the liabilities
giving rise to claims under the indemnification provisions of this 12.01 which
is permissible under applicable law.

Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, provided that in the

case of any such participation, the participant shall not have any rights under
this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents (the participant's rights
against such Bank in respect of such participation to be those set forth in the
agreement executed by such Bank in favor of the participant relating thereto)
and all amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder shall be determined as if such
Bank had not sold such participation, except that the participant shall be
entitled to the benefits of Sections 1.10, 1.11, 2.05, and 4.04 of this
Agreement to the extent that such Bank would be entitled to such benefits if the
participation had not been entered into or sold, and provided further, that no

Bank shall transfer, grant or assign any participation under which the
participant shall have rights to approve any amendment to or waiver of this
Agreement or any other Credit Document except to the extent such amendment or
waiver would (i) extend the final scheduled maturity of any Loan or Note in
which such participant is participating (it being understood that any waiver of
an installment on, the application of any prepayment or the method of any
application of any prepayment to the amortization of the Term Loans shall not
constitute an extension of the final scheduled maturity date) or reduce the rate
or extend the time of payment of interest or Fees thereon (except in connection
with a waiver of the applicability of any post-default increase in interest
rates), or reduce the principal amount thereof, or increase such participant's
participating interest in any Commitment over the amount thereof then in effect
(it being understood that a waiver of any Default or Event of Default or of a
mandatory reduction in the Total Commitment, or a mandatory prepayment, shall
not constitute a change in the terms of any Commitment and that an increase in
any Commitment shall be permitted without the consent of any participant if such
participant's participation is not increased as a result thereof), (ii) release
all or substantially all of the Collateral (except as expressly provided in the
Credit Documents) or (iii) consent to the assignment or transfer by the Borrower
of any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement or any other Credit
Document (except as expressly provided herein or therein).

          (b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) any Bank may assign all or a
portion of its Loans and/or Commitments and its rights and obligations hereunder
to its parent company and/or any affiliate of such Bank which is at least 50%
owned by such Bank or its parent company or to one or more Banks and (y) any
Bank may assign a portion, in an amount

                                     -139-

equal to at least the Minimum Assignment Amount (or the remaining balance
thereof if less) of its Loans and/or Commitments and its rights and obligations
hereunder to a Person that is a commercial bank, other financial institution,
mutual fund or "Accredited Investor" as such term is defined in Regulation D of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (each an "Eligible Assignee") , each of
which Eligible Assignees shall be reasonably acceptable to the Administrative
Agent and the Borrower and shall become a party to this Agreement as a Bank
prior to or after the Initial Borrowing Date by executing an assignment
agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit L hereto, appropriately
completed (an "Assignment Agreement") with the assigning Bank, provided that,
                                                               --------
in each case, (i) at such time Schedule I shall be deemed to have been
modified to reflect the Loans and/or Commitments of such new Bank and of the
existing Banks, (ii) if requested by such new Bank or the assigning Bank, the
Borrower shall issue new Notes to such new Bank and to the assigning Bank in
conformity with the requirements of Section 1.05 to the extent needed to
reflect the revised Loans and/or Commitments, and (iii) the Administrative
Agent shall have received at the time of each such assignment from either the
assigning or assignee Bank the payment of a nonrefundable assignment fee of
$3,000. Assignments pursuant to this Section 12.04(b) shall not be required to
be prorata between the Term Loan Commitments and/or outstanding Term Loans and
   -------
the Revolving Commitments. To the extent of any assignment pursuant to this
Section 12.04(b), the assigning Bank shall be relieved of its obligations
hereunder with respect to its assigned Loans and/or Commitments. No Bank may
assign all or a portion of its Revolving Commitment to an Eligible Assignee
not already a Bank hereunder unless each Letter of Credit Issuer shall have
consented in writing to such assignment. At the time of each assignment
pursuant to this Section 12.04(b) to a Person which is not already a Bank
hereunder and which is not a United States person (as such term is defined in
Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. Federal income taxes, the respective
assignee Bank shall, to the extent legally entitled to do so, provide to the
Borrower the forms described in Section 4.04(b)(ii). Nothing in this Section
12.04(b) shall prevent or prohibit any Bank from pledging its Loans or Notes
hereunder to a Federal Reserve Bank in support of borrowings made by such Bank
from such Federal Reserve Bank.

          (c)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 12.04, no
transfer or assignment of the interests or obligations of any Bank hereunder or
any grant of participations therein shall be permitted if such transfer,
assignment

                                     -140-
<PAGE>
 
or grant would require the Borrower to file a registration statement or qualify
an indenture with the SEC or to qualify the Loans under the "Blue Sky" laws of
any State.

          (d)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 12.04, any
transfer or assignment of the interests or obligations of any Bank hereunder
shall be subject to such limitations as may be imposed by the Administrative
Agent in its sole discretion.

          12.05  No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative.  No failure or delay on the
                 ------------------------------                             
part of the Administrative Agent, any Co-Agent or any Bank in exercising any
right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document and no
course of dealing between any Credit Party and the Administrative Agent, any Co-
Agent or any Bank shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other
Credit Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder.  The rights and
remedies herein expressly provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any
rights or remedies which the Administrative Agent, any Co-Agent or any Bank
would otherwise have.  No notice to or demand on any Credit Party in any case
shall entitle any Credit Party to any other or further notice or demand in
similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the
Administrative Agent, any Co-Agent or the Banks to any other or further action
in any circumstances without notice or demand.

          12.06  Payments Pro Rata.  (a)  Except as otherwise provided by this

Agreement, the Administrative Agent agrees that promptly after its receipt of
each payment from or on behalf of the Borrower in respect of any Obligations, it
shall, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, distribute such payment
to the Banks (other than any Bank that has consented in writing to waive its pro
                                                                             ---

of the Obligations with respect to which such payment was received.

          (b)  Each of the Banks agrees that, if it should receive any amount
hereunder (whether by voluntary payment, by realization upon security, by the
exercise of the right of setoff or banker's lien, by counterclaim or cross
action, by the enforcement of any right under the Credit Documents, or
otherwise) which is applicable to the payment of the principal of, or interest
on, the Loans, Unpaid Drawings or Fees,

of a sum which with respect to the related sum or sums received by other Banks
is in a greater proportion than the total of such Obligation then owed and due
to such Bank bears to the total of such Obligations then owed and due to all of
the Banks immediately prior to such receipt, then such Bank receiving such
excess payment shall purchase for cash without recourse or warranty from the
other Banks an interest in the Obligations in such amount as shall result in a
proportional participation by all of the Banks in such amount, provided that if
                                                               --------        
all or any portion of such excess amount is thereafter recovered from such
Bank, such purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the
extent of such recovery, but without interest.

be furnished to the Banks pursuant hereto shall be made and prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods involved
(except as set forth in the notes thereto or as otherwise disclosed in writing
by the Borrower to the Banks), provided that, except as otherwise specifically

provided herein, all computations determining compliance with Sections 4.02 and
8, including definitions used therein, shall utilize accounting principles and
policies in effect at the time of the preparation of, and in conformity with
those used to prepare, the 1993 historical financial statements delivered to the
Banks pursuant to Section 6.11(b).

          (b)  All computations of interest, Commitment Commission and Fees
hereunder shall be made on the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360
days.

          (c)  All determinations of the Stated Amount of Letters of Credit and
of the principal amount of Unpaid Drawings, in each case to the extent
denominated in a currency other than Dollars, shall be made by converting same
into Dollars at (x) in the case of a determination of the Borrower's obligation
to reimburse in Dollars a drawing under a Letter of Credit denominated in a
currency other than Dollars or of each Participating Bank's obligation pursuant
to Section 2.02(c) to pay the amount of such Participating Bank's Percentage of
an unreimbursed payment in respect of any such Letter of Credit, the spot
exchange rate for the currency in question of the respective Letter of Credit
Issuer on the date of such drawing or (y) if the provisions of the foregoing
clause (x) are not applicable, the spot exchange rate for the currency in
question calculated by the Administrative Agent on the last day of the month
preceding the month in which any such determination is being made and

at such other times as the Administrative Agent elects to make such
determination, it being understood that the Administrative Agent shall have no
obligation to make any such other determinations.
