shall pay its proportionate share of the Common Areas Costs and Expenses, Taxes and Insurance ("CAM") for the Premises
as hereinafter provided. For the purpose of determining Tenant's share of CAM, and Tenant's share of Impositions in the next following
section, Tenant's proportionate share shall be the percentage obtained by dividing the rentable square feet of the Premises by

on Landlord's estimate of what CAM will be for each respective calendar year during the Lease Term. CAM for a partial calendar
year during the Lease Term shall be prorated. At the end of each calendar year or partial calendar year during the Lease Te1m,
when Landlord has determined actual CAM for such period, Tenant shall be credited with the estimated payments made during such
period, and any overpayment shall be refunded to Tenant and any underpayment shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord within thirty
(30) days of the determination of the same. Tenant's initial monthly CAM installments beginning on the Rent Commencement Date

equal to ($ Dollars per month, based on the Premises containing 7,000 rentable square feet and the Building containing 41,500
rentable square feet. Tenant's proportionate share of CAM shall be adjusted proportionately if the square footage of the Premises
or the Building changes. Landlord shall determine the amount of CAM for the Building and Tenant shall be furnished with a statement
thereof within ninety (90) days after the end of each calendar year, but Landlord's failure to provide such statement shall not
relieve Tenant of the obligation to pay any amounts due when the statement is furnished. Tenant shall pay in a Jump sum any amount
due with respect to the preceding pat1ial calendar year or calendar year to Landlord within thirty (30) days after receipt of
such statement, all subsequent monthly installments paid by Tenant to Landlord, beginning with the first month of each calendar
year or partial calendar year, for CAM, shall be adjusted based on actual CAM for the immediately preceding calendar year. CAM
Charges (exclusive of real estate taxes, insurance, and uncontrollable CAM Charges such as snow/ice removal and utility expenses
for exterior lighting) will not increase by more than five (5%) percent non-cumulative per calendar year. 1. Common Areas Costs
and Expenses: Common Areas Costs and Expenses shall mean and include all amounts paid or incurred by Landlord for operating, managing,
insuring, and maintaining the Building, including the buildings, improvements and Common Areas facilities of the Building in a

Tenant's proportionate share of all taxes, assessments and charges (hereinafter sometimes called "Impositions") paid
or incurred by Landlord during each calendar year (including a calendar year which contains a partial calendar year within the
Lease Term) for ad valorem taxes, real estate taxes, user fees, or any other tax on rents or real estate as such (other than income
taxes thereon) from time to time directly or indirectly assessed or imposed upon the Building and the land upon which it is situated

    	5



    	 



    

 



contesting, or in negotiating with the
public authorities as to the amount of such assessments, charges or taxes or the basis upon which the same shall be assessed.
Tenant's proportionate share of said Impositions shall be computed by multiplying the total sum of said Impositions for the applicable
period by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of rentable square feet of the Premises and the denominator of
which shall be the total number of rentable square feet in the Building. Tenant's proportionate share of said Impositions shall
be paid, along with other monthly installments of Monthly Base Rent and CAM charges, in advance in monthly installments estimated
by Landlord and subsequently adjusted, resulting from the actual Impositions exceeding (or falling short of) estimated payments.
Monthly Installments for each subsequent calendar year shall thereafter be estimated by Landlord at the beginning of each such
calendar year on the basis of the actual Impositions for the preceding calendar year. Landlord shall deliver to Tenant a statement
certifying the actual total amount thereof and the amount of Tenant's proportionate share thereof. Along with the next monthly
rental installment, Tenant shall pay to Landlord such amounts as may be necessary to effect adjustment of the amount paid or payable
for the prior calendar or partial calendar year to the actual amount of Tenant's proportionate share of such Impositions for such
year. Landlord shall credit any excess payments made by Tenant against future installments to be paid by Tenant hereunder, or
in the event of the last year of the Lease, such excess shall be refunded to Tenant. If the Lease Term shall begin or end on a
date other than the first (lst) or last day of a calendar year, the first (1st) and/or final annual charges to Tenant with respect
to the aforesaid Impositions shall be prorated on a daily basis on the basis of a three hundred sixty-five (365) day calendar
year. The foregoing provisions to the contrary notwithstanding, it is understood and agreed that any and all assessments or charges
for ad valorem real estate taxes or other taxes on business or personal property or any other tax on real estate or business or
personal property as such from time to time directly or indirectly assessed or imposed upon with respect to any alterations, additions
or improvements made to the Premises by Tenant or under its direction or with respect to any property of Tenant therein shall
be borne and paid entirely by Tenant and if any of said items or any portion thereof shall be paid by Landlord, Tenant shall reimburse

Landlord for the same immediately upon
receipt by Tenant of written demand therefore from Landlord.iii. Insurance. Landlord shall, during the entire Lease Term hereof,
maintain in force casualty insurance on its interest in the Building in such amounts and against such hazards and contingencies
as Landlord shall deem desirable for its own protection; provided, however, Landlord shall not be obligated to insure any furniture,
equipment, or other property placed in the Premises by or at the expense of Tenant. Tenant shall not permit any use of the Premises
that would invalidate or conflict with the terms of any hazard insurance policy covering risks insured by Landlord, excluding
use as a bank. Landlord shall, in addition, during the entire Lease Term hereof, maintain liability insurance on the Common Areas
with limits of not less than Two Million and No/100 ($2,000,000.00) Dollars, with all tenants in the Building named as additional
insureds and Tenant shall pay, as Additional Rent, its proportionate share of Landlord's liability insurance premium. Tenant shall
pay, as Additional Rent, its proportionate share of Landlord's hazard insurance premiums. Tenant shall also pay the entire increase
in Landlord's hazard insurance premiums which may be caused by the Tenant's use and occupancy of, or improvements to, the Premises,
excluding use as a bank. Said increases in insurance premiums shall be due and payable to the Landlord within thirty (30) days
after a statement therefore is rendered to the Tenant by the Landlord, which statement shall also include the amount of direct
increase caused by Tenant's use and occupancy of, or improvements to, the Premises, if any. Tenant shall at Tenant's expense,
obtain and keep in force at all times during the Initial Term and Lease Term, commercial general liability insurance including,
property damage on an occurrence basis with limits of not less than Two Million ($2,000,000) Dollars combined single limit insuring
Landlord, Landlord's agent and property manager, as additional insureds, and Tenant against any liability arising out of the ownership,
use, occupancy or maintenance of the Premises and all areas appurtenant thereto. The limit of said insurance shall not, however
limit the liability of the Tenant hereunder. Tenant may carry said insurance under a blanket policy providing an endorsement naming
Landlord and Landlord's agent and property manager as an additional insured. Insurance required hereunder shall be in companies
licensed in the State that the Premises are located and shall have a "Best's Insurance Guide" rating of B+/VI or better.
Mutual insurance companies may be used only if they are non-assessable. No policy shall be cancelable or subject to reduction
of coverage except after thirty (30) days written notice to Landlord. All policies of


 




    	7



    	 



    

  



insurance maintained by Tenant shall
be in a form acceptable to Landlord with satisfactory evidence that all premiums have been paid. Tenant agrees not to knowingly
violate or permit to be violated any of the conditions or provisions of the insurance policies required to be furnished hereunder,
and agrees to promptly notify Landlord or Landlord's Agent of any fire or other casualty within twenty-four (24) hours. Tenant
shall, at Tenant's expense, obtain and keep in force at all times during the Lease Term, personal property insurance with regard
to Tenant's furniture, fixtures, and equipment placed in, on or about the Premises. d. Late Payment. If Monthly Base Rent or any
other payment due hereunder from Tenant to Landlord remains unpaid ten (10) days after said payment is due, the amount of such
unpaid rent or other payment shall be increased by a late charge to be paid to Landlord by Tenant in an amount equal to five (5%)
percent of the amount of the delinquent rent or other payment after written notice is sent. The amount of the late charge to be
paid for such month shall be computed on the aggregate amount of delinquent rent and other payment then outstanding for such month.
Landlord and Tenant agree that such late charge shall not be deemed to be a penalty, it being understood between the pat1ies that
late payments by Tenant shall result in additional administrative expense to Landlord which is difficult and impractical to ascertain
and that such late charge is a reasonable estimate of the loss and expense to be suffered by Landlord as a result of such late
payment by Tenant. If rent or any other sums due Landlord by Tenant hereunder shall not be paid with thirty (30) days of its due
date, then in such case in addition to the late charge provided for hereinabove, and after written notice from Landlord to Tenant,
such rent or other sum shall bear interest beginning on the thirty-first (31st) day after its due date at the rate of eighteen
(18%) percent per annum (or, if less, the highest rate allowed by law). If rent or any other sums due Landlord by Tenant hereunder
is collected by or through an attorney at law, Tenant agrees to pay Landlord's actual and reasonable attorneys' fe.es incurred
with respect thereto. Nothing herein shall relieve Tenant of the obligation to pay rent or any other payment on or before the
date on which any such payment is due, nor in any way limit Landlord's remedies under this Lease or at law in the event said rent
or other payment is unpaid after it is due. e. Rent Commencement Date. Unless otherwise provided, all of the terms and provisions
of the Lease will be effective as of the date of Lease execution with the exception of the obligation to pay Monthly Base Rent,
Additional Rent, and Impositions. The Lease Term of the Lease and the obligation to pay rent and all Additional Rent, shall commence

area of the Premises so taken and the reduction shall be effective on the date physical possession is taken by the condemning
authority. If any portion of the Common Areas of the Building is taken for any public or quasi-public use under any governmental
law, ordinance or regulation, or by right of eminent domain, or by private purchase in l ieu thereof, this Lease shall continue

to Landlord; provided, Landlord shall have no interest in any such award made to Tenant for loss of business or for the taking
of Tenant's fixtures and other tangible property within the Premises if a separate award for such items is made to Tenant. Notwithstanding
anything contained in this Lease to the contrary, Tenant shall not be prevented from making a claim against the condemning authority
(but not against Landlord) and Landlord shall cooperate with Tenant in making such claim for any moving expenses, loss of profits,
or taking of its personal property and for the value of the unexpired term (including any option period) of this Lease to which

to comply with any other of the rules, regulations, agreements, covenants, terms and conditions contained or referred to herein
(other than the failure to pay sums of money) for a period of fifteen (15) days after Landlord has notified Tenant of the default(s)
provided that if such default is not susceptible of being cured within such fifteen (15) day period, the time permitted Tenant
to cure the default(s) shall be extended for as long as shall be reasonably necessary to cure such default(s) if Tenant commences
promptly and proceeds diligently to cure such default(s); provided, always, that such period for curing any default shall not
be so extended as to jeopardize the interest of Landlord in the Premises or Building or other property of Landlord or so as to
subject Landlord to any civil or criminal liabilities. c. Filing by or against Tenant in any court pursuant to any statute, either
of the United States or of any state, of a petition in bankruptcy or insolvency, or for reorganization, or for any arrangement
or for appointment of a receiver or trustees of all or a portion of Tenant's property or should Tenant make any assignment for
the benefit of its creditors; provided, that if the action or proceeding be against Tenant, the same shall not be an event of
default if the petition shall be dismissed within six (6) months after commencement thereof. d. Dissolution or liquidation of
Tenant, voluntary or involuntary, or the taking of possession of any of Tenant's property by execution and levy of attachment.
Any failure of Landlord to perform any of its obligations under this Lease shall not be considered a default unless Tenant shall
have given Landlord at least a fifteen (15) day written notice and opportunity to cure the same, unless another time period is
specifically provided for in this Lease, or if such obligation cannot reasonably be performed or such failure reasonably cured
within said period, Landlord shall have such additional time as is reasonably necessary to perform the obligation or cure the
default. 18. Remedies Upon Default. a. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default by Tenant as described in paragraph 17 hereof,

following remedies: 1. Landlord with or without terminating this Lease may immediately or at any time thereafter reenter the Premises

Landlord as Additional Rent within fifteen ( 15) days of rendition of any statement to Tenant by Landlord for any expenditures
made by Landlord in making such corrections or repairs. n. Landlord with or without terminating this Lease may immediately or

not be entitled to receive any excess of any such rents collected over the rents reserved herein. v. Landlord may immediately
or at any time thereafter terminate this Lease (without notice or demand to vacate the Premises which Tenant hereby waives) and

termination Landlord shall have and recover from Tenant all damages Landlord may suffer by reason of such termination including
without limitation the cost (including legal expenses and reasonable attorney's fees) of recovering possession of the Premises,
the costs of any repairs to the Premises which are necessary or proper to prepare the same for reletting and in addition thereto
Landlord at its election shall have and recover from Tenant either (A) an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the total amount

the remainder of the term of this Lease or (B) the rents which Landlord would be entitled to receive from Tenant pursuant to the
provisions of subparagraph (iv) above if the Lease


 




    	19



    	 



    

 



were not terminated
and such election shall be made by Landlord by serving written notice of its choice of one of two said alternatives upon Tenant
within thirty (30) days of the notice of termination. In the event of any re-entry of the Premises by Landlord pursuant to any
of the provisions of this Lease, Tenant hereby waives all claims for damages, except such claims arising out of proven acts of
negligence by Landlord, which may be caused by such re-entry by Landlord and Tenant shall save Landlord harmless from any loss,
cost (including without limitation legal expenses and reasonable attorney's fees) or damages suffered by Landlord by reason of
such re-entry and no such re-entry shall be considered or construed to be a forcible entry. No course of dealing between Landlord
and Tenant or any delay on the part of Landlord in exercising any rights it may have under this Lease shall operate as a waiver
of any of the rights of Landlord hereunder nor shall any waiver *of a prior default operate as a waiver of any subsequent
default or defaults and no express waiver shall affect any condition, covenant, rule or regulation other than the one specified
in such waiver and that one only for the time and in the ma1mer specifically stated. The exercise by Landlord of any one or more
of the remedies provided in this Lease shall not prevent the subsequent exercise by Landlord of any one or more of the other remedies
herein provided. All remedies of Landlord, may be exercised alternatively, successively or in any other manner and are in addition
to any other rights provided by law. b. Nothing herein contained shall limit or prejudice the right of Landlord to prove and obtain

the right of Landlord to collect the deficiency for any subsequent month by a similar action. d. Tenant hereby expressly waives,
so far as permitted by Jaw, the service of any notice of intention to re-enter provided in any statute, or of the institution
of legal proceedings to that end. Tenant, for and on behalf of any and all persons claiming through or under Tenant, also waives
any right of redemption or re-entry or repossession or restoration of Tenant's possessory rights hereunder in the event Tenant
shall be dispossessed by a judgment or by action of any court or judge or in case of re-entry or repossession by Landlord as a
result of Tenant's default. Landlord and Tenant, so far as permitted by law, waive trial by jury in any action, proceeding, or
counterclaim brought by either of the parties hereto against the other on any matter arising out of or in any way connected with
this Lease, the relationship of Landlord and Tenant, Tenant's use or occupancy of the Premises, or any claim of injury or damage.
e. Any action taken by Landlord under this paragraph shall not operate as a waiver of any right Landlord would otherwise have
against Tenant for breach of this Lease and


 




    	20



    	 



    

 



Tenant shall remain
liable to Landlord for any damages suffered by Landlord by Reason of Tenant's default or breach. f. The Landlord shall also be

in this Lease, and in the event of such breach shall have all rights and remedies allowed at law, in equity, by statute, or otherwise.

not prevent Landlord from pursuing other remedies in law or equity in the event of breach or default of Tenant. The terms "enter",
"re-enter", "entry" or "re-entry" as used in this Lease are not restricted to their technical legal
meaning. 19. Landlord's Performance for Account of Tenant. If Tenant shall continue in default in the performance of any of the
covenants or agreements herein contained after the expiration of the time limit hereinabove set forth for the curing of said default(s),

which any such expense shall have been incurred) may be added at the option of Landlord, to any rent then due or thereafter falling
due hereunder. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent Landlord from immediately collecting from Tenant by suit
or otherwise, any such sums with interest. 20. Indemnity - Insurance. During the Lease Term, Tenant, its assigns agree to indemnify
and defend Landlord and to save harmless Landlord, and agents, servants and employees of Landlord against and from any and all

occurring in or about the Premises or in the Building occasioned by Tenant, or by any employee (whether or not acting within the
scope of employment), agent , licensee, Invitee or visitor of Tenant, or by reason of any breach, violation or nonperformance
of any covenant in this Lease on the part of Tenant to be observed or performed, and also by reason of any matter or thing growing

Tenant expressly agrees to save Landlord harmless in all such cases. Throughout the Lease Term, Tenant shall carry fire and extended
coverage insurance insuring its interest, if any, in improvements to or in the Premises and in its interest in its office furniture,
equipment supplies and other property. Tenant hereby waives any claim or right of action, which it may have against Landlord for
loss or damage covered by such insurance and Tenant covenants and agrees that it will obtain a waiver from the carrier of such
insurance releasing such carrier's subrogation rights as against Landlord. Copies of all of Tenant's insurance policies shall
be delivered to Landlord upon request. Tenant shall not do or cause to be done or permit on the Premises anything deemed extra
hazardous on account of fire or other risk and Tenant shall not use the Premises in any manner which will cause an increase in

be raised, Tenant shall pay Landlord on demand the amount of any such increase in premium which Landlord shall pay for such insurance
and if Landlord shall demand that Tenant remedy the condition which caused any such increase in an insurance premium rate, Tenant
shall remedy such condition within five (5) days after receipt of such demand. 23. Application of Payments Received from Tenant.
Landlord, acting in its sole discretion, shall have the right to apply any payments made by Tenant to the satisfaction of any
debt or obligation of Tenant to Landlord regardless of the instructions of Tenant as to application of any sum whether such instructions
be endorsed upon Tenant's check or otherwise, unless otherwise agreed upon by both parties in writing. The acceptance by Landlord
of a check drawn by others than Tenant shall in no way affect Tenant's liability hereunder nor shall it be deemed an approval
of any assignment of this Lease by Tenant. 24. Subordination. Tenant shall, upon request by Landlord, subject and subordinate
all or any of Its rights under this Lease to any and all mortgages and deeds of trust now existing or hereafter placed on the
Building or the land upon which the Building is located; provided, however, that the holder of any such mortgage agrees in writing
that Tenant will not be disturbed in the use or enjoyment of the Premises so long as it is not in default hereunder. Tenant agrees
that this Lease shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any default or foreclosure under any such mortgage or deed
of trust and that it will attorn to the mortgagee, trustee or beneficiary of such mortgage or deed of trust, and their successors
or assigns, and to the purchaser or assignee under any such foreclosure. Tenant will, upon request by Landlord, execute and deliver
to Landlord, or to any other person designated by Landlord, any instrument or instruments required to give effect to the provisions

by Landlord in Landlord's sole discretion. If the Tenant is a corporation, the sale,


 




    	22



    	 



    

 



transfer or encumbrance
of a majority of its outstanding voting stock or equity interests (whether the result of a single or series of transactions),
excluding merger, sale of assets, or consolidation with another banking institution or dissolution, shall be deemed an assignment
of this Lease and shall be subject to the provisions contained herein relative to assignment. Likewise, if Tenant is a partnership,
limited liability company, or any other entity, the sale, transfer or encumbrance of a majority of its voting or ownership or
equity interests (whether the result of a single or series of transactions) shall be deemed an assignment of this Lease and shall
be subject to the provisions contained herein relative to assignment. a. Reasonableness. The Landlord's consent shall not be considered
unreasonably withheld if: i. The proposed subtenant's or assignee's financial responsibility does not meet the same criteria Landlord
uses to select comparable Building tenants; ii. The proposed subtenant's or assignee's business is not suitable for the Building
considering the business of the other tenants and the Building's prestige; or iii. The proposed use is inconsistent with the use
permitted by Article 30. b. Procedure. Tenant must provide Landlord in writing: i. The name and address of the proposed subtenant
or assignee; ii. The nature of the proposed subtenant's or assignee's business it will operate in the Premises; iii. The terms
of the proposed sublease or assignment; and iv. Reasonable financial information so that Landlord can evaluate the proposed subtenant
or assignee under this paragraph. Landlord shall, within thirty (30) days after receiving the information required under this
Article, give notice to Tenant to permit or deny the proposed sublease or assignment. [f Landlord denies consent, it must explain
the reasons for the denial. If Landlord does not give notice within the thirty (30) day periods, then Tenant may sublease or assign

    	23



    	 



    

 



iv. Consent to one
sublease or assignment does not waive the consent requirement for future assignments or subleases. v. Fifty (50%) percent of the
consideration (Excess Consideration) received by Tenant from an assignment or sublease that exceeds the amount Tenant must pay
Landlord, which amount is to be prorated where a part of the Premises is subleased, shall also be paid to Landlord. Excess Consideration
shall exclude reasonable leasing commissions paid by Tenant, payments attributable to the amortization of the cost of Tenant improvements
made to the Premises at Tenant's cost for the assignee or sublessee, and other reasonable, out*of-pocket costs paid by
Tenant, such as attorneys' fees directly related to Tenant's obtaining an assignee or sublessee. Tenant shall pay this Excess
Consideration to Landlord at the end of each calendar year during which Tenant collects any Excess Consideration. Each payment
shall be sent with a detailed statement showing (A) the total consideration paid by the subtenant or assignee and (B) any exclusion
from the consideration permitted by this paragraph. Landlord shall have the right to audit Tenant's books and records to verify
the accuracy of the detailed statement. 26. Mechanic's Liens. Tenant shall have no right to encumber or subject the interest of
Landlord in the Premises to any mechanic's materialmen's, or other liens of any nature whatsoever, and upon the filing of any
such lien, the failure of Tenant to have the same canceled promptly shall constitute a default and entitle Landlord at its option
to take any action provided for elsewhere in this Lease. Tenant shall hold Landlord harmless from any such liens. 27. Holding
Over. Upon the expiration of the term or other termination of this Lease, Tenant shall quit and surrender the Premises to Landlord,
broom clean, in good order and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted and Tenant shall remove from the Premises all of its
property. If Tenant shall hold over after the expiration of this term or other termination of this Lease, such holding over shall
